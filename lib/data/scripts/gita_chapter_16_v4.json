          "Ramanujacharya (English)": "The Lord said 'Fear' is the pain arising from the awareness of the cause which brings about pain in the form of either dissociation from the objects of attainment or association with the objects of aversion. The absence of this is 'fearlessness'. 'Purity of mind' is the condition of Sattva, viz., the state of the internal organ being untouched by Rajas and Tamas. 'Devotion to meditation on the knowledge (of the self)' is firm adherence to the discrimination between the pure nature of the self and Prakrti. 'Alms-giving' is the giving away of one's wealth earned through right means to the deserving. 'Self-control' is the practice of withdrawal of the mind from sense-objects. 'Worship' is the performance of the fivefold duties (sacrifices) etc., of life in the spirit of worship of the Lord without attachment to the fruits. The 'study of the Vedas' is devotion to the Vedic study with the conviction that all the teachings of the Vedas deal with the Lord, with His glorious nature and with the mode of worshipping Him. 'Austerity' is the practice of penances like Krchra, Candrayana, vow on the twelfth day of the lunar fortnight, etc., which foster capability for performing acts pleasing to the Lord. 'Uprightness' consists of the oneness of thought, word and deed in one's dealings with others.",

            "English": "अभयम् fearlessness, सत्त्वसंशुद्धिः purity of heart, ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थितिः steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga, दानम् atmsgiving, दमः control of the senses, च and, यज्ञः sacrifice, च and, स्वाध्यायः study of Sastras, तपः austerity, आर्जवम् straightforwardness.Commentary: The Lord made a mention of the three kinds of Nature that belong to sentient beings, viz., the nature of the gods, Asuras and Rakshasas, in the ninth discourse (verses 12 and 13). He now describes them in detail in this discourse. The distinction between the god or the godman and the Asuras is clearly drawn in the first, second, third and fourth verses. Daivi Prakriti or the nature of the gods leads to Moksha or release from the round of birth and death. The nature of the Asuras and Rakshasas leads to bondage. This is an obstacle to the attainment of knowledge of the Self. The divine nature must be accepted and cultivated the Asuric and Rakshasic nature should be abandoned. All these alities are found in human beings. There are Sattvic people who possess the divine attributes there are Asuras and Rakshasas among human beings also, who are endowed with demoniacal alities, who are filled with excessive Tamas. In an ordinary man there is a mixture of the three Gunas. Tamas and Rajas pull a man downwards Sattva lifts a man upwards. Tamas and Rajas lead to bondage Sattva helps to attain salvation. Discipline yourself and develop Sattva This is the foundation of Yoga. This is the first preparatory discipline. The first rung in the spiritual ladder is reached by developing Sattva. When the mind is Sattvic, thee is calmness in it. Divine light can descend only when the mind is serene and cheerful.The Sattvic man controls the senses, does selfless service, and practises Japa, Pranayama, concentration, meditation, selfanalysis and eniry of Who am I He is not attracted by sensual objects. He has a burning desire for attaining Moksha. He is humble, generous, merciful, forbearing, tolerant and pious. He destroys his little personality. The Rajasic man is proud, intolearnt, egoistic, selfsufficient, lustful, hottermpered, greedy and jealous. He works for his own glory and fame and selfaggrandisement. he develops his own little vain personality.There is intimate connection between the Gunas and Karmas. The nature of the Karmas depends upon the nature of the Gunas. A Sattvic man will do virtuous actions. A Rajasic and Tamasic man will perform evil actions. It is the Guna that goads a man to do actions. The Self or Brahman is actionless. It is the silent witness.The Lord sums up in the first three verses the alities of a godly man who is inclined to the path of liberation. He then enumerates the alities of the demoniacal man. The theme of this chapter is the tracing of the difference between the divine and the Asuric nature.Virtue and vice are relative terms. The virtue of one period will become the vice of the other. From the transcendental point of view, there is neither virtue nor vice.Why should there be evil How did evil arise -- these are all transcendental estions (Atiprasnas). You can get answers to these estions only when you attain Selfrealisation. People unnecessarily rack their brains to get an answer to these estions. It is a serious mistake.Daivi Sampat (divine wealth or the wealth of divine alities) helps the aspirant to attain knowledge of the Self. The Sattvic or divine attributes such as fearlessness, purity of heart, control of the senses, etc., constitute Daivi Sampat. They enable the aspirant to attain the highest state of superconsciousness (Nirvikalpa Samadhi) wherein the seer and the seen are united in one, the meditator and the meditated become identical. Divine alities or attributes which go to augment the bliss of the Self, which help the aspirant to attain the happiness of the Self, are called divine,wealth.Among the divine alities, fearlessness stands foremost. Fear is an effect of ignorance. Identification with the body causes fear. Blind attachment to the body, wife, children, house or property is the cause of fear. The sge who has realised the Self is absolutely fearless.He who knows the Bliss of Brahman from which words as well as the mind turn powerless, fears nothing. (Taittiriya Upanishad)Fearlessness is the devout observance of the precepts enjoined in the scriptures without doubting. The state of being free from the fear, How can I live now when I have renounced everything, when I have none to support me is fearlessness. A Sannyasi resolves when he takes Sannyasa, I will not induce fear in any living creature. Keeping up this resolve of Abhaya Dana (gift of the boon of fearlessness to all creatures) in thought, word and deed is Abhayam or fearlessness. Fear can be removed by constant thinking of the immortal and allblissful nature of the Self. If you lead a life of honesty and truthfulness, if you devoutly observe the precepts of the scriptures without doubting, if you lead a life of right conduct, and if you remember God always, you will become fearless. When one beholds the Self only everywhere, when the sense of duality has vanished, when the sense of unity has dawned in him, how can he be afraid of anything, how can the feeling of fear arise in him Fearlessness is essential for the attainment of Moksha or salvation. Fearlessness is the chief characteristic of a liberated sage. It is the one accurate measure of ones spiritual progress. It is the cardinal virtue of an illumined sage. That is the reason why it is placed in the forefront of all divine alities. Only a liberated sage can be absolutely fearless.Sattvic Subha Vasana (good tendency) is Daivi Sampat. It induces a man to practise discrimination, dispassion, control of the mind and the senses, etc., which help him to attain knowledge of the Self. The Rajasic and the Tamasic (Asubha or evil) Vasnas (tendencies) which operate along the currents of RagaDvesha (likes and dislikes), which induce one to perform actions which are prohibited by the scriptures and which produce disastrous effects, constitute demoniacal nature.In Asuric nature inclination towards sensual pleasures is predominant in Rakshasic nature hatred predominates and the Rakshasa does various sorts of harm and injury to others.Good tendencies lead to Moksha. Evil tendencies lead to bondage. Good tendencies must be cultivated. Evil tendencies should be eradicated. You shoul first have a knowledge of the essential nature of these two Vasanas, if you wish to cultivate the good tendencies and eradicate the evil ones. This sixteenth discourse gives a vivid description of these tendencies.Sattvasamsuddhih Purity of understanding, cleanliness of life or purity of heart. Purity of mind, i.e., giving up of cheating, hypocrisy, untruth and the like, in all dealings with the people, and doing transactions with perfect honesty and integrity is Sattvasamsuddhi.When the understanding abides constantly in the immortal Self and is thus firm and steadfast, you may know this to be a condition of purity. On account of purity the mind can know the Self. The state of the mind wherein it is free from doubts like Asambhavana (thought of improbability of the existence of the Self), etc., through hearing of the scriptures is Sattvasamsuddhi. As purity of mind cannot be obtained without devotion to the Lord, devotion is implied in these Sattvic virtues.Jnana Knowledge understanding the nature of the Self, as taught in the scriptures and by the preceptor Selfrealisation through meditation on the Great Sentence of the Upanishad. I am Brahman (Aham Brahmasmi), is Jnana.Yoga is union of the individual soul with the Supreme Being it is the direct realisation of the Self by concentration and meditation, through selfrestraint or control of the senses. The aspirant cognises through direct perception by the inner eye of intuition or wisdom what has been learnt from the scriptures and the preceptor. The aspirant attains Selfrealisation or direct knowledge. He becomes one with Brahman -- the Absolute. He gets indirect knowledge or mere understanding or theoretical knowledge of Brahman from the scriptures. Now through the practice of Yoga he gets direct knowledge. The attempt which is favourable for the annihilation of the mind and the latent tendencies is also known as Yoga.Jnanayogavyavasthitih The state of Jivanmukti attained through Jnana Yoga, which is distinct from the state of the worldlyminded persons.Fearlessness, purity of heart and steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga are the three preeminent virtues amongst the Sattvic attributes enumerated in verses 1 to 3. They are found in Jnana Yogins only. The other alities are common to Jnana Yogins, Karma Yogins, Raja Yogins and Bhaktas. Unless you possess Sattvic virtues, you cannot practise any kind of Yoga. If you cultivate one virtue, all other virtues will cling to you by themselves. Fearlessness is the basis and foundation of the whole of mans moral structure within.Svadhyaya and Tamas constitute Kriya Yoga. Svadhyaya constitutes BrahmaYajna. Almsgiving and sacrifice pertain to Karma Yoga. Almsgiving, selfcontrol and sacrifice constitute Daivi Sampat for householders. Those alities mentioned in chapter XVI, verses 1 to 3, which belong to the aspirant who practises a particular form of Yoga constitute the Daivi Sampat of the disciple on that path.Dana Almsgiving distributing food, clothes, etc., as far as it iles in ones power, according to ones means. A charitable man hastens to comfort the distressed and helps the needy. Charity is of three kinds, viz., Sattvic, Rajasic and Tamasic (see chapter XVII, 20 to 22). It opens the gates of heaven. It will bring nearer the means of liberation. Just as the tree gives fruit and shade without distinction, so also give to him who needs, without distinction, with a cheerful heart.Dama Selfrestraint, selfcontrol, control of the external senses. The control of the inner senses or the mind is described in the next verse.The practice of selfcontrol annihilates the union between the senses and the sensual objects. It separates the senses from their respective objects. The aspirant will not allow the wind of the sensual objects to blow through the gateway of his senses. He keeps the senses under the strictest restraint. He lights the fire of dispassion at all the ten gates of the body. He takes rigid vows. He observes Mauna (the vow of silence) and celibacy. He is moderate in his diet. He keeps the golden medium in everything. He checks the outgoing tendencies of the mind and the senses. He induces the mind and the senses to turn backwards towards their source. Just as an enemy is cut down by means of a weapon, so also every tendency towards sensual objects is cut down by the practice of selfcontrol. All internal promptings, cravings and Vasanas should be burnt in the fire of renunciation, at the ten gates of the senses. As householders cannot practise perfect control of the senses, even moderation or regulated and disciplined life will constitute selfrestraint for them. The practice of selfcontrol includes forgiveness, harmlessness, truth, steadiness and,patience.Yajna Sacrifice. The fireworship (Agnihotra) and the like enjoined in the Vedas and also the sacrifice to the gods (DevaYajna) or worship of the gods, PitriYajna, BhutaYajna, ManushyaYajna and BrahmaYajna enjoined in the scriptures (Smritis).Svadhyaya Study of the Vedas in order to attain the unseen fruits.Tapas Austerity, moritification of the body and other forms of penance. True Tapas is meditation on the Self. It is fixing the mind on Brahman or the Self. It is to separate oneself from the physical body and the other four sheaths and to identify oneself with the Absolute. It is to turn the mind towards the soul. The three kinds of Tapas mentioned in chapter XVII, verses 14 to 16 come under this category.Arjavam Straightforwardness. This is conducive to the attainment of knowledge. The aspirant should always be candid, upright or straightforward. Straightforwardness should be his constant attitutde. A just and truthful man alone can be straightforward. He is respected by the people. He is liked by all. He attains success in all his endeavours. He never hides facts or truth."

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या--[पंद्रहवें अध्यायके उन्नीसवें श्लोकमें भगवान्ने कहा कि 'जो मुझे पुरुषोत्तम जान लेता है, वह सब प्रकारसे मेरा ही भजन करता है अर्थात् वह मेरा अनन्य भक्त हो जाता है। इस प्रकार एकमात्र भगवान्का उद्देश्य होनेपर साधकमें दैवी-सम्पत्ति स्वतः प्रकट होने लग जाती है। अतः भगवान् पहले तीन श्लोकोंमें क्रमशः भाव, आचरण और प्रभावको लेकर दैवी-सम्पत्तिका वर्णन करते हैं।] अभयम् (टिप्पणी प0 790.1)--अनिष्टकी आशङ्कासे मनुष्यके भीतर जो घबराहट होती है, उसका नाम भय है और उस भयके सर्वथा अभावका नाम 'अभय' है। भय दो रीतिसे होता है--(1) बाहरसे और (2) भीतरसे। (1) बाहरसे आनेवाला भय--(क) चोर, डाकू, व्याघ्र, सर्प आदि प्राणियोंसे जो भय होता है, वह बाहरका भय है। यह भय शरीरनाशकी आशङ्कासे ही होता है। परन्तु जब यह अनुभव हो जाता है कि यह शरीर नाशवान् है और जानेवाला ही है, तो फिर भय नहीं रहता। बीड़ीसिगरेट, अफीम, भाँग, शराब आदिके व्यसनोंको छो़ड़नेका एवं व्यसनी मित्रोंसे अपनी मित्रता टूटनेका जो भय होता है, वह मनुष्यकी अपनी कायरतासे ही होता है। कायरता छोड़नेसे यह भाव नहीं रहता। (ख) अपने वर्ण, आश्रम आदिके अनुसार कर्तव्यपालन करते हुए उसमें भगवान्की आज्ञाके विरुद्ध कोई काम न हो जाय हमें विद्या पढ़ानेवाले, अच्छी शिक्षा देनेवाले आचार्य, गुरु, सन्तमहात्मा, मातापिता आदिके वचनोंकी आज्ञाकी अवहेलना न हो जाय हमारे द्वारा शास्त्र और कुलमर्यादाके विरुद्ध कोई आचरण न बन जाय -- इस प्रकारका भय भी बाहरी भय कहलाता है। परन्तु यह भय वास्तवमें भय नहीं है, प्रत्युत यह तो अभय बनानेवाला भय है। ऐसा भय तो साधकके जीवनमें होना ही चाहिये। ऐसा भय होनेसे ही वह अपने मार्गपर ठीक तरहसे चल सकता है। कहा भी है -- हरिडर, गुरुडर, जगतडर, डर करनी में सार। रज्जब डर्या सो ऊबर्या, गाफिल खायी मार।। (2) भीतरसे पैदा होनेवाला भय--(क) मनुष्य जब पाप, अन्याय, अत्याचार आदि निषिद्ध आचरण करना चाहता है, तब (उनको करनेकी भावना मनमें आते ही) भीतरसे भय पैदा होता है। मनुष्य निषिद्ध आचरण तभीतक करता है, जबतक उसके मनमें मेरा शरीर बना रहे, मेरा मानसम्मान होता रहे, मेरेको सांसारिक भोगपदार्थ मिलते रहें, इस प्रकार सांसारिक जड वस्तुओंकी प्राप्तिका और उनकी रक्षाका उद्देश्य रहता है (टिप्पणी प0 790.2)। परन्तु जब मनुष्यका एकमात्र उद्देश्य चिन्मयतत्त्वको प्राप्त करनेका हो जाता है (टिप्पणी प0 791.1), तब उसके द्वारा अन्याय, दुराचार छूट जाते हैं और वह सर्वथा अभय हो जाता है। कारण कि उसके लक्ष्य परमात्मतत्त्वमें कभी कमी नहीं आती और वह कभी नष्ट नहीं होता। (ख) जब मनुष्यके आचरण ठीक नहीं होते और वह अन्याय, अत्याचार आदिमें लगा रहता है, तब उसको भय लगता है। जैसे, रावणसे मनुष्य, देवता, यक्ष, राक्षस आदि सभी डरते थे, पर वही रावण जब सीताका हरण करनेके लिये जाता है, तब वह डरता है। ऐसे ही कौरवोंकी अठारह अक्षौहिणी सेनाके बाजे बजे, तो उसका पाण्डवसेनापर कुछ भी असर नहीं हुआ (गीता 1। 13), पर जब पाण्डवोंकी सात अक्षौहिणी सेनाके बाजे बजे, तब कौरवसेनाके हृदय विदीर्ण हो गये (1। 19)। तात्पर्य यह है कि अन्याय, अत्याचार करनेवालोंके हृदय कमजोर हो जाते है, इसलिये वे भयभीत होते हैं। जब मनुष्य अन्याय आदिको छोड़कर अपने आचरणों एवं भावोंको शुद्ध बनाता है, तब उसका भय मिट जाता है। (ग) मनुष्यशरीर प्राप्त करके यह जीव जबतक करनेयोग्यको नहीं करता, जाननेयोग्यको नहीं जानता और पानेयोग्यको नहीं पाता? तबतक वह सर्वथा अभय नहीं हो सकता उसके जीवनमें भय रहता ही है। भगवान्की तरफ चलनेवाला साधक भगवान्पर जितनाजितना अधिक विश्वास करता है और उनके आश्रित होता है? उतनाहीउतना वह अभय होता चला जाता है। उसमें स्वतः यह विचार आता है कि मैं तो परमात्माका अंश हूँ अतः कभी नष्ट होनेवाला नहीं हूँ, तो फिर भय किस बातका (टिप्पणी प0 791.2) और संसारके अंश शरीर आदि सब पदार्थ प्रतिक्षण नष्ट हो रहे हैं, तो फिर भय किस बातका ऐसा विवेक स्पष्टरूपसे प्रकट होनेपर भय स्वतः नष्ट हो जाता है और साधक सर्वथा अभय हो जाता है। भगवान्के साथ सम्बन्ध जोड़नेपर, भगवान्को ही अपना माननेपर शरीर, कुटुम्ब आदिमें ममता नहीं रहती। ममता न रहनेसे मरनेका भय नहीं रहता और साधक अभय हो जाता है। 'सत्त्वसंशुद्धिः'-- अन्तःकरणकी सम्यक् शुद्धिको सत्त्वसंशुद्धि कहते हैं। सम्यक् शुद्धि क्या है संसारसे रागरहित होकर भगवान्में अनुराग हो जाना ही अन्तःकरणकी सम्यक् शुद्धि है। जब अपना विचार, भाव, उद्देश्य, लक्ष्य केवल एक परमात्माकी प्राप्तिका हो जाता है, तब अन्तःकरण शुद्ध हो जाता है। कारण कि नाशवान् वस्तुओंकी प्राप्तिका उद्देश्य होनेसे ही अन्तःकरणमें मल, विक्षेप और आवरण -- ये तीन तरहके दोष आते हैं। शास्त्रोंमें मलदोषको दूर करनेके लिये निष्कामभावसे कर्म (सेवा), विक्षेपदोषको दूर करनेके लिये उपासना और आवरणदोषको दूर करनेके लिये ज्ञान बताया है। यह होनेपर भी अन्तःकरणकी शुद्धिके लिये सबसे बढ़िया उपाय है -- अन्तःकरणको अपना न मानना। साधकको पुराने पापको दूर करनेके लिये या किसी परिस्थितिके वशीभूत होकर किये गये नये पापको दूर करनेके लिये अन्य प्रायश्चित्त करनेकी उतनी आवश्यकता नहीं है। उसको तो चाहिये कि वह जो साधन कर रहा है, उसीमें उत्साह और तत्परतापूर्वक लगा रहे। फिर उसके ज्ञातअज्ञात सब पाप दूर हो जायँगे और अन्तःकरण स्वतः शुद्ध हो जायगा। साधकमें ऐसी एक भावना बन जाती है कि साधनभजन करना अलग काम है और व्यापारधंधा आदि करना अलग काम है अर्थात् ये दोनों अलगअलग विभाग हैं। इसलिये व्यापार आदि व्यवहारमें झूठकपट आदि तो करने ही पड़ते हैं -- ऐसी जो छूट ली जाती है? उससे अन्तःकरण बहुत ही अशुद्ध होता है। साधनके साथसाथ जो असाधन होता रहता है, उससे साधनमें जल्दी उन्नति नहीं होती। इसलिये साधकको सदा सावधान रहना चाहिये अर्थात् नये पाप कभी न बने -- ऐसी सावधानी सदासर्वदा बनी रहनी चाहिये। साधक भूलसे किये हुए दुष्कर्मोंके अनुसार अपनेको दोषी मान लेता है और अपना बुरा करनेवाले व्यक्तिको भी दोषी मान लेता है, जिससे उसका अन्तःकरण अशुद्ध हो जाता है। उस अशुद्धिको मिटानेके लिये साधकको चाहिये कि वह भूलसे किये हुए दुष्कर्मको पुनः कभी न करनेका दृढ़ व्रत ले ले तथा अपना बुरा करनेवाले व्यक्तिके अपराधको क्षमा माँगे बिना ही क्षमा कर दे और भगवान्से प्रार्थना करे कि हे नाथ मेरा जो कुछ बुरा हुआ है, वह तो मेरे दुष्कर्मोंका ही फल है। वह बेचारा तो मुफ्तमें ही ऐसा कर बैठा है। उसका इसमें कोई दोष नहीं है। आप उसे क्षमा कर दें। ऐसा करनेसे अन्तःकरण शुद्ध हो जाता है। 'ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थितिः'-- ज्ञानके लिये योगमें स्थित होना अर्थात् परमात्मतत्त्वका जो ज्ञान (बोध) है, वह चाहे सगुणका हो या निर्गुणका, उस ज्ञानके लिये योगमें स्थित होना आवश्यक है। योगका अर्थ है -- सांसारिक पदार्थोंकी प्राप्तिअप्राप्तिमें, मानअपमानमें, निन्दास्तुतिमें, रोगनीरोगतामें सम रहना अर्थात् अन्तःकरणमें हर्षशोकादि न होकर निर्विकार रहना। 'दानम्'-- लोकदृष्टिमें जिन वस्तुओंको अपना माना जाता है, उन वस्तुओंको सत्पात्रका तथा देश, काल, परिस्थिति आदिका विचार रखते हुए आवश्यकतानुसार दूसरोंको वितीर्ण कर देना दान है। दान कई तरहके होते हैं जैसे भूमिदान, गोदान, स्वर्णदान, अन्नदान, वस्त्रदान आदि। इन सबमें अन्नदान प्रधान है। परन्तु इससे भी अभयदान प्रधान (श्रेष्ठ) है (टिप्पणी प0 792.1)। उस अभयदानके दो भेद होते हैं --, (1) संसारकी आफतसे, विघ्नोंसे, परिस्थितियोंसे भयभीत हुएको अपनी शक्ति, सामर्थ्यके अनुसार भयरहित करना, उसे आश्वासन देना, उसकी सहायता करना। यह अभयदान उसके शरीरादि सांसारिक पदार्थोंको लेकर होता है। (2) संसारमें फँसे हुए व्यक्तिको जन्ममरणसे रहित करनेके लिये भगवान्की कथा आदि सुनाना (टिप्पणी प0 792.2)। गीता, रामायण, भागवत आदि ग्रन्थोंको एवं उनके भावोंको सरलभाषामें छपवाकर सस्ते दामोंमें लोगोंको देना अथवा कोई समझना चाहे तो उसको समझाना, जिससे उसका कल्याण हो जाय। ऐसे दानसे भगवान् बहुत राजी होते हैं (गीता 18। 68 -- 69) क्योंकि भगवान् ही सबमें परिपूर्ण हैं। अतः जितने अधिक जीवोंका कल्याण होता है, उतने ही अधिक भगवान् प्रसन्न होते हैं। यह सर्वश्रेष्ठ अभयदान है। इसमें भी भगवत्सम्बन्धी बातें दूसरोंको सुनाते समय साधक वक्ताको यह सावधानी रखनी चाहिये कि वह दूसरोंकी अपेक्षा अपनेमें विशेषता न माने, प्रत्युत इसमें भगवान्की कृपा माने कि भगवान् ही श्रोताओंके रूपमें आकर मेरा समय सार्थक कर रहे हैं। ऊपर जितने दान बताये हैं, उनके साथ अपना सम्बन्ध न जोड़कर साधक ऐसा माने कि अपने पास वस्तु, सामर्थ्य, योग्यता आदि जो कुछ भी है, वह सब भगवान्ने दूसरोंके सेवा करनेके लिये मुझे निमित्त बनाकर दी है। अतः भगवत्प्रीत्यर्थ आवश्यकतानुसार जिसकिसीको जो कुछ दिया जाय, वह सब उसीका समझकर उसे देना दान है। 'दमः'-- इन्द्रियोंको पूरी तरह वशमें करनेका नाम दम है। तात्पर्य यह है कि इन्द्रियाँ, अन्तःकरण और शरीरसे कोई भी प्रवृत्ति शास्त्रनिषिद्ध नहीं होनी चाहिये। शास्त्रविहित प्रवृत्ति भी अपने स्वार्थ और अभिमानका त्याग करके केवल दूसरोंके हितके लिये ही होनी चाहिये। इस प्रकारकी प्रवृत्तिसे इन्द्रियलोलुपता, आसक्ति और पराधीनता नहीं रहती एवं शरीर और इन्द्रियोंके बर्ताव शुद्ध, निर्मल होते हैं। साधकका उद्देश्य इन्द्रियोंके दमनका होनेसे अकर्तव्यमें तो उसकी प्रवृत्ति होती ही नहीं और कर्तव्यमें स्वाभाविक प्रवृत्ति होती है, तो उसमें स्वार्थ, अभिमान आसक्ति, कामना आदि दोष नहीं रहते। यदि कभी किसी कार्यमें स्वार्थभाव आ भी जाता है, तो वह उसका दमन करता चला जाता है, जिससे अशुद्धि मिटती जाती है और शुद्धि होती चली जाती है और आगे चलकर उसका दम अर्थात् इन्द्रियसंयम सिद्ध हो जाता है। 'यज्ञः'-- यज्ञ शब्दका अर्थ आहुति देना होता है। अतः अपने वर्णाश्रमके अनुसार होम, बलिवैश्वदेव आदि करना यज्ञ है। इसके सिवाय गीताकी दृष्टिसे अपने वर्ण, आश्रम, परिस्थिति आदिके अनुसार जिसकिसी समय जो कर्तव्य प्राप्त हो जाय, उसको स्वार्थ और अभिमानका त्याग करके दूसरोंके हितकी,भावनासे या भगवत्प्रीत्यर्थ करना यज्ञ है। इसके अतिरिक्त जीविकासम्बन्धी व्यापार, खेती आदि तथा शरीरनिर्वाहसम्बन्धी खानापीना, चलनाफिरना, सोनाजागना, देनालेना आदि सभी क्रियाएँ भगवत्प्रीत्यर्थ करना यज्ञ है। ऐसे ही मातापिता, आचार्य, गुरुजन आदिकी आज्ञाका पालन करना, उनकी सेवा करना, उनको मन, वाणी, तन और धनसे सुख पहुँचाकर उनकी प्रसन्नता प्राप्त करना और गौ, ब्राह्मण, देवता, परमात्मा आदिका पूजन करना, सत्कार करना -- ये सभी यज्ञ हैं। 'स्वाध्यायः' -- अपने ध्येयकी सिद्धिके लिये भगवन्नामका जप और गीता, भागवत, रामायण, महाभारत आदिके पठनपाठनका नाम स्वाध्याय है। वास्तवमें तो 'स्वस्य अध्यायः (अध्ययनम्) स्वाध्यायः' के अनुसार अपनी वृत्तियोंका, अपनी स्थितिका ठीक तरहसे अध्ययन करना ही स्वाध्याय है। इसमें भी साधकको न तो अपनी वृत्तियोंसे अपनी स्थितिकी कसौटी लगानी है और न वृत्तियोंके अधीन अपनी स्थिति ही माननी है। कारण कि वृत्तियाँ तो हरदम आतीजाती रहती हैं, बदलती रहती हैं। तो फिर स्वाभाविक यह प्रश्न उठता है कि क्या हम अपनी वृत्तियोंको शुद्ध न करें वास्तवमें तो साधकका कर्तव्य वृत्तियोंको शुद्ध करनेका ही होना चाहिये और वह शुद्धि अन्तःकरण तथा उसकी वृत्तियोंको अपना न माननेसे बहुत जल्दी हो जाती है क्योंकि उनको अपना मानना ही मूल अशुद्धि है। साक्षात् परमात्माका अंश होनेसे अपना स्वरूप कभी अशुद्ध हुआ ही नहीं। केवल वृत्तियोंके अशुद्ध होनेसे ही उसका यथार्थ अनुभव नहीं होता। 'तपः' -- भूखप्यास, सरदीगरमी, वर्षा आदि सहना भी एक तप है, पर इस तपमें भूखप्यास आदिको जानकर सहते हैं। वास्तवमें साधन करते हुए अथवा जीवननिर्वाह करते हुए देश, काल, परिस्थिति आदिको लेकर जो कष्ट, आफत, विघ्न आदि आते हैं, उनको प्रसन्नतापूर्वक सहना ही तप है (टिप्पणी प0 793.1) क्योंकि इस तपमें पहले किये गये पापोंका नाश होता है औह सहनेवालेमें सहनेकी एक नयी शक्ति, एक नया बल आता है। साधकको सावधान रहना चाहिये कि वह उस तपोबलका प्रयोग दूसरोंको वरदान देनेमें, शाप देने या अनिष्ट करनेमें तथा अपनी इच्छापूर्ति करनेमें न लगाये, प्रत्युत उस बलको अपने साधनमें जो बाधाएँ आती हैं, उनको प्रसन्नतासे सहनेकी शक्ति बढ़ानेमें ही लगाये। साधक जब साधन करता है, तब वह साधनमें कई तरहसे विघ्न मानता है। वह समझता है कि मुझे एकान्त मिले तो मैं साधन कर सकता हूँ, वायुमण्डल अच्छा हो तो साधन कर सकता हूँ इत्यादि। इन सब अनुकूलताओंकी चाहना न करना अर्थात् उनके अधीन न होना भी तप है। साधकको अपना साधन परिस्थितियोंके अधीन नहीं मानना चाहिये, प्रत्युत परिस्थितिके अनुसार अपना साधन बना लेना चाहिये। साधकको अपनी चेष्टा तो एकान्तमें साधन करनेकी करनी चाहिये, पर एकान्त न मिले तो मिली हुई परिस्थितिको भगवान्की भेजी हुई समझकर विशेष उत्साहसे प्रसन्नतापूर्वक साधनमें प्रवृत्ति होना चाहिये। 'आर्जवम्'-- सरलता, सीधेपनको आर्जव कहते हैं। यह सरलता साधकका विशेष गुण है। यदि साधक यह चाहता है कि दूसरे लोग मुझे अच्छा समझें, मेरा व्यवहार ठीक नहीं होगा तो लोग मुझे बढ़िया नहीं मानेंगे, इसलिये मुझे सरलतासे रहना चाहिये, तो यह एक प्रकारका कपट ही है। इसमें साधकमें बनावटीपन आता है, जब कि साधकमें सीधा, सरल भाव होना चाहिये। सीधा, सरल होनेके कारण लोग उसको मूर्ख, बेसमझ कह सकते हैं, पर उससे साधककी कोई हानि नहीं है। अपने उद्धारके लिये तो सरलता बड़े कामकी चीज है -- 'कपट गाँठ मन में नहीं, सबसों सरल सुभाव।' नारायन ता भक्त की, लगी किनारे नाव।। इसलिये साधकके शरीर, वाणी और मनके व्यवहारमें कोई बनावटीपन नहीं रहना चाहिये (टिप्पणी प0 793.2)। उसमें स्वाभाविक सीधापन हो।",

            "Devnagri": "व्याख्या--[पंद्रहवें अध्यायके उन्नीसवें श्लोकमें भगवान्ने कहा कि 'जो मुझे पुरुषोत्तम जान लेता है, वह सब प्रकारसे मेरा ही भजन करता है अर्थात् वह मेरा अनन्य भक्त हो जाता है। इस प्रकार एकमात्र भगवान्का उद्देश्य होनेपर साधकमें दैवी-सम्पत्ति स्वतः प्रकट होने लग जाती है। अतः भगवान् पहले तीन श्लोकोंमें क्रमशः भाव, आचरण और प्रभावको लेकर दैवी-सम्पत्तिका वर्णन करते हैं।] अभयम् (टिप्पणी प0 790.1)--अनिष्टकी आशङ्कासे मनुष्यके भीतर जो घबराहट होती है, उसका नाम भय है और उस भयके सर्वथा अभावका नाम 'अभय' है। भय दो रीतिसे होता है--(1) बाहरसे और (2) भीतरसे। (1) बाहरसे आनेवाला भय--(क) चोर, डाकू, व्याघ्र, सर्प आदि प्राणियोंसे जो भय होता है, वह बाहरका भय है। यह भय शरीरनाशकी आशङ्कासे ही होता है। परन्तु जब यह अनुभव हो जाता है कि यह शरीर नाशवान् है और जानेवाला ही है, तो फिर भय नहीं रहता। बीड़ीसिगरेट, अफीम, भाँग, शराब आदिके व्यसनोंको छो़ड़नेका एवं व्यसनी मित्रोंसे अपनी मित्रता टूटनेका जो भय होता है, वह मनुष्यकी अपनी कायरतासे ही होता है। कायरता छोड़नेसे यह भाव नहीं रहता। (ख) अपने वर्ण, आश्रम आदिके अनुसार कर्तव्यपालन करते हुए उसमें भगवान्की आज्ञाके विरुद्ध कोई काम न हो जाय हमें विद्या पढ़ानेवाले, अच्छी शिक्षा देनेवाले आचार्य, गुरु, सन्तमहात्मा, मातापिता आदिके वचनोंकी आज्ञाकी अवहेलना न हो जाय हमारे द्वारा शास्त्र और कुलमर्यादाके विरुद्ध कोई आचरण न बन जाय -- इस प्रकारका भय भी बाहरी भय कहलाता है। परन्तु यह भय वास्तवमें भय नहीं है, प्रत्युत यह तो अभय बनानेवाला भय है। ऐसा भय तो साधकके जीवनमें होना ही चाहिये। ऐसा भय होनेसे ही वह अपने मार्गपर ठीक तरहसे चल सकता है। कहा भी है -- हरिडर, गुरुडर, जगतडर, डर करनी में सार। रज्जब डर्या सो ऊबर्या, गाफिल खायी मार।। (2) भीतरसे पैदा होनेवाला भय--(क) मनुष्य जब पाप, अन्याय, अत्याचार आदि निषिद्ध आचरण करना चाहता है, तब (उनको करनेकी भावना मनमें आते ही) भीतरसे भय पैदा होता है। मनुष्य निषिद्ध आचरण तभीतक करता है, जबतक उसके मनमें मेरा शरीर बना रहे, मेरा मानसम्मान होता रहे, मेरेको सांसारिक भोगपदार्थ मिलते रहें, इस प्रकार सांसारिक जड वस्तुओंकी प्राप्तिका और उनकी रक्षाका उद्देश्य रहता है (टिप्पणी प0 790.2)। परन्तु जब मनुष्यका एकमात्र उद्देश्य चिन्मयतत्त्वको प्राप्त करनेका हो जाता है (टिप्पणी प0 791.1), तब उसके द्वारा अन्याय, दुराचार छूट जाते हैं और वह सर्वथा अभय हो जाता है। कारण कि उसके लक्ष्य परमात्मतत्त्वमें कभी कमी नहीं आती और वह कभी नष्ट नहीं होता। (ख) जब मनुष्यके आचरण ठीक नहीं होते और वह अन्याय, अत्याचार आदिमें लगा रहता है, तब उसको भय लगता है। जैसे, रावणसे मनुष्य, देवता, यक्ष, राक्षस आदि सभी डरते थे, पर वही रावण जब सीताका हरण करनेके लिये जाता है, तब वह डरता है। ऐसे ही कौरवोंकी अठारह अक्षौहिणी सेनाके बाजे बजे, तो उसका पाण्डवसेनापर कुछ भी असर नहीं हुआ (गीता 1। 13), पर जब पाण्डवोंकी सात अक्षौहिणी सेनाके बाजे बजे, तब कौरवसेनाके हृदय विदीर्ण हो गये (1। 19)। तात्पर्य यह है कि अन्याय, अत्याचार करनेवालोंके हृदय कमजोर हो जाते है, इसलिये वे भयभीत होते हैं। जब मनुष्य अन्याय आदिको छोड़कर अपने आचरणों एवं भावोंको शुद्ध बनाता है, तब उसका भय मिट जाता है। (ग) मनुष्यशरीर प्राप्त करके यह जीव जबतक करनेयोग्यको नहीं करता, जाननेयोग्यको नहीं जानता और पानेयोग्यको नहीं पाता? तबतक वह सर्वथा अभय नहीं हो सकता उसके जीवनमें भय रहता ही है। भगवान्की तरफ चलनेवाला साधक भगवान्पर जितनाजितना अधिक विश्वास करता है और उनके आश्रित होता है? उतनाहीउतना वह अभय होता चला जाता है। उसमें स्वतः यह विचार आता है कि मैं तो परमात्माका अंश हूँ अतः कभी नष्ट होनेवाला नहीं हूँ, तो फिर भय किस बातका (टिप्पणी प0 791.2) और संसारके अंश शरीर आदि सब पदार्थ प्रतिक्षण नष्ट हो रहे हैं, तो फिर भय किस बातका ऐसा विवेक स्पष्टरूपसे प्रकट होनेपर भय स्वतः नष्ट हो जाता है और साधक सर्वथा अभय हो जाता है। भगवान्के साथ सम्बन्ध जोड़नेपर, भगवान्को ही अपना माननेपर शरीर, कुटुम्ब आदिमें ममता नहीं रहती। ममता न रहनेसे मरनेका भय नहीं रहता और साधक अभय हो जाता है। 'सत्त्वसंशुद्धिः'-- अन्तःकरणकी सम्यक् शुद्धिको सत्त्वसंशुद्धि कहते हैं। सम्यक् शुद्धि क्या है संसारसे रागरहित होकर भगवान्में अनुराग हो जाना ही अन्तःकरणकी सम्यक् शुद्धि है। जब अपना विचार, भाव, उद्देश्य, लक्ष्य केवल एक परमात्माकी प्राप्तिका हो जाता है, तब अन्तःकरण शुद्ध हो जाता है। कारण कि नाशवान् वस्तुओंकी प्राप्तिका उद्देश्य होनेसे ही अन्तःकरणमें मल, विक्षेप और आवरण -- ये तीन तरहके दोष आते हैं। शास्त्रोंमें मलदोषको दूर करनेके लिये निष्कामभावसे कर्म (सेवा), विक्षेपदोषको दूर करनेके लिये उपासना और आवरणदोषको दूर करनेके लिये ज्ञान बताया है। यह होनेपर भी अन्तःकरणकी शुद्धिके लिये सबसे बढ़िया उपाय है -- अन्तःकरणको अपना न मानना। साधकको पुराने पापको दूर करनेके लिये या किसी परिस्थितिके वशीभूत होकर किये गये नये पापको दूर करनेके लिये अन्य प्रायश्चित्त करनेकी उतनी आवश्यकता नहीं है। उसको तो चाहिये कि वह जो साधन कर रहा है, उसीमें उत्साह और तत्परतापूर्वक लगा रहे। फिर उसके ज्ञातअज्ञात सब पाप दूर हो जायँगे और अन्तःकरण स्वतः शुद्ध हो जायगा। साधकमें ऐसी एक भावना बन जाती है कि साधनभजन करना अलग काम है और व्यापारधंधा आदि करना अलग काम है अर्थात् ये दोनों अलगअलग विभाग हैं। इसलिये व्यापार आदि व्यवहारमें झूठकपट आदि तो करने ही पड़ते हैं -- ऐसी जो छूट ली जाती है? उससे अन्तःकरण बहुत ही अशुद्ध होता है। साधनके साथसाथ जो असाधन होता रहता है, उससे साधनमें जल्दी उन्नति नहीं होती। इसलिये साधकको सदा सावधान रहना चाहिये अर्थात् नये पाप कभी न बने -- ऐसी सावधानी सदासर्वदा बनी रहनी चाहिये। साधक भूलसे किये हुए दुष्कर्मोंके अनुसार अपनेको दोषी मान लेता है और अपना बुरा करनेवाले व्यक्तिको भी दोषी मान लेता है, जिससे उसका अन्तःकरण अशुद्ध हो जाता है। उस अशुद्धिको मिटानेके लिये साधकको चाहिये कि वह भूलसे किये हुए दुष्कर्मको पुनः कभी न करनेका दृढ़ व्रत ले ले तथा अपना बुरा करनेवाले व्यक्तिके अपराधको क्षमा माँगे बिना ही क्षमा कर दे और भगवान्से प्रार्थना करे कि हे नाथ मेरा जो कुछ बुरा हुआ है, वह तो मेरे दुष्कर्मोंका ही फल है। वह बेचारा तो मुफ्तमें ही ऐसा कर बैठा है। उसका इसमें कोई दोष नहीं है। आप उसे क्षमा कर दें। ऐसा करनेसे अन्तःकरण शुद्ध हो जाता है। 'ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थितिः'-- ज्ञानके लिये योगमें स्थित होना अर्थात् परमात्मतत्त्वका जो ज्ञान (बोध) है, वह चाहे सगुणका हो या निर्गुणका, उस ज्ञानके लिये योगमें स्थित होना आवश्यक है। योगका अर्थ है -- सांसारिक पदार्थोंकी प्राप्तिअप्राप्तिमें, मानअपमानमें, निन्दास्तुतिमें, रोगनीरोगतामें सम रहना अर्थात् अन्तःकरणमें हर्षशोकादि न होकर निर्विकार रहना। 'दानम्'-- लोकदृष्टिमें जिन वस्तुओंको अपना माना जाता है, उन वस्तुओंको सत्पात्रका तथा देश, काल, परिस्थिति आदिका विचार रखते हुए आवश्यकतानुसार दूसरोंको वितीर्ण कर देना दान है। दान कई तरहके होते हैं जैसे भूमिदान, गोदान, स्वर्णदान, अन्नदान, वस्त्रदान आदि। इन सबमें अन्नदान प्रधान है। परन्तु इससे भी अभयदान प्रधान (श्रेष्ठ) है (टिप्पणी प0 792.1)। उस अभयदानके दो भेद होते हैं --, (1) संसारकी आफतसे, विघ्नोंसे, परिस्थितियोंसे भयभीत हुएको अपनी शक्ति, सामर्थ्यके अनुसार भयरहित करना, उसे आश्वासन देना, उसकी सहायता करना। यह अभयदान उसके शरीरादि सांसारिक पदार्थोंको लेकर होता है। (2) संसारमें फँसे हुए व्यक्तिको जन्ममरणसे रहित करनेके लिये भगवान्की कथा आदि सुनाना (टिप्पणी प0 792.2)। गीता, रामायण, भागवत आदि ग्रन्थोंको एवं उनके भावोंको सरलभाषामें छपवाकर सस्ते दामोंमें लोगोंको देना अथवा कोई समझना चाहे तो उसको समझाना, जिससे उसका कल्याण हो जाय। ऐसे दानसे भगवान् बहुत राजी होते हैं (गीता 18। 68 -- 69) क्योंकि भगवान् ही सबमें परिपूर्ण हैं। अतः जितने अधिक जीवोंका कल्याण होता है, उतने ही अधिक भगवान् प्रसन्न होते हैं। यह सर्वश्रेष्ठ अभयदान है। इसमें भी भगवत्सम्बन्धी बातें दूसरोंको सुनाते समय साधक वक्ताको यह सावधानी रखनी चाहिये कि वह दूसरोंकी अपेक्षा अपनेमें विशेषता न माने, प्रत्युत इसमें भगवान्की कृपा माने कि भगवान् ही श्रोताओंके रूपमें आकर मेरा समय सार्थक कर रहे हैं। ऊपर जितने दान बताये हैं, उनके साथ अपना सम्बन्ध न जोड़कर साधक ऐसा माने कि अपने पास वस्तु, सामर्थ्य, योग्यता आदि जो कुछ भी है, वह सब भगवान्ने दूसरोंके सेवा करनेके लिये मुझे निमित्त बनाकर दी है। अतः भगवत्प्रीत्यर्थ आवश्यकतानुसार जिसकिसीको जो कुछ दिया जाय, वह सब उसीका समझकर उसे देना दान है। 'दमः'-- इन्द्रियोंको पूरी तरह वशमें करनेका नाम दम है। तात्पर्य यह है कि इन्द्रियाँ, अन्तःकरण और शरीरसे कोई भी प्रवृत्ति शास्त्रनिषिद्ध नहीं होनी चाहिये। शास्त्रविहित प्रवृत्ति भी अपने स्वार्थ और अभिमानका त्याग करके केवल दूसरोंके हितके लिये ही होनी चाहिये। इस प्रकारकी प्रवृत्तिसे इन्द्रियलोलुपता, आसक्ति और पराधीनता नहीं रहती एवं शरीर और इन्द्रियोंके बर्ताव शुद्ध, निर्मल होते हैं। साधकका उद्देश्य इन्द्रियोंके दमनका होनेसे अकर्तव्यमें तो उसकी प्रवृत्ति होती ही नहीं और कर्तव्यमें स्वाभाविक प्रवृत्ति होती है, तो उसमें स्वार्थ, अभिमान आसक्ति, कामना आदि दोष नहीं रहते। यदि कभी किसी कार्यमें स्वार्थभाव आ भी जाता है, तो वह उसका दमन करता चला जाता है, जिससे अशुद्धि मिटती जाती है और शुद्धि होती चली जाती है और आगे चलकर उसका दम अर्थात् इन्द्रियसंयम सिद्ध हो जाता है। 'यज्ञः'-- यज्ञ शब्दका अर्थ आहुति देना होता है। अतः अपने वर्णाश्रमके अनुसार होम, बलिवैश्वदेव आदि करना यज्ञ है। इसके सिवाय गीताकी दृष्टिसे अपने वर्ण, आश्रम, परिस्थिति आदिके अनुसार जिसकिसी समय जो कर्तव्य प्राप्त हो जाय, उसको स्वार्थ और अभिमानका त्याग करके दूसरोंके हितकी,भावनासे या भगवत्प्रीत्यर्थ करना यज्ञ है। इसके अतिरिक्त जीविकासम्बन्धी व्यापार, खेती आदि तथा शरीरनिर्वाहसम्बन्धी खानापीना, चलनाफिरना, सोनाजागना, देनालेना आदि सभी क्रियाएँ भगवत्प्रीत्यर्थ करना यज्ञ है। ऐसे ही मातापिता, आचार्य, गुरुजन आदिकी आज्ञाका पालन करना, उनकी सेवा करना, उनको मन, वाणी, तन और धनसे सुख पहुँचाकर उनकी प्रसन्नता प्राप्त करना और गौ, ब्राह्मण, देवता, परमात्मा आदिका पूजन करना, सत्कार करना -- ये सभी यज्ञ हैं। 'स्वाध्यायः' -- अपने ध्येयकी सिद्धिके लिये भगवन्नामका जप और गीता, भागवत, रामायण, महाभारत आदिके पठनपाठनका नाम स्वाध्याय है। वास्तवमें तो 'स्वस्य अध्यायः (अध्ययनम्) स्वाध्यायः' के अनुसार अपनी वृत्तियोंका, अपनी स्थितिका ठीक तरहसे अध्ययन करना ही स्वाध्याय है। इसमें भी साधकको न तो अपनी वृत्तियोंसे अपनी स्थितिकी कसौटी लगानी है और न वृत्तियोंके अधीन अपनी स्थिति ही माननी है। कारण कि वृत्तियाँ तो हरदम आतीजाती रहती हैं, बदलती रहती हैं। तो फिर स्वाभाविक यह प्रश्न उठता है कि क्या हम अपनी वृत्तियोंको शुद्ध न करें वास्तवमें तो साधकका कर्तव्य वृत्तियोंको शुद्ध करनेका ही होना चाहिये और वह शुद्धि अन्तःकरण तथा उसकी वृत्तियोंको अपना न माननेसे बहुत जल्दी हो जाती है क्योंकि उनको अपना मानना ही मूल अशुद्धि है। साक्षात् परमात्माका अंश होनेसे अपना स्वरूप कभी अशुद्ध हुआ ही नहीं। केवल वृत्तियोंके अशुद्ध होनेसे ही उसका यथार्थ अनुभव नहीं होता। 'तपः' -- भूखप्यास, सरदीगरमी, वर्षा आदि सहना भी एक तप है, पर इस तपमें भूखप्यास आदिको जानकर सहते हैं। वास्तवमें साधन करते हुए अथवा जीवननिर्वाह करते हुए देश, काल, परिस्थिति आदिको लेकर जो कष्ट, आफत, विघ्न आदि आते हैं, उनको प्रसन्नतापूर्वक सहना ही तप है (टिप्पणी प0 793.1) क्योंकि इस तपमें पहले किये गये पापोंका नाश होता है औह सहनेवालेमें सहनेकी एक नयी शक्ति, एक नया बल आता है। साधकको सावधान रहना चाहिये कि वह उस तपोबलका प्रयोग दूसरोंको वरदान देनेमें, शाप देने या अनिष्ट करनेमें तथा अपनी इच्छापूर्ति करनेमें न लगाये, प्रत्युत उस बलको अपने साधनमें जो बाधाएँ आती हैं, उनको प्रसन्नतासे सहनेकी शक्ति बढ़ानेमें ही लगाये। साधक जब साधन करता है, तब वह साधनमें कई तरहसे विघ्न मानता है। वह समझता है कि मुझे एकान्त मिले तो मैं साधन कर सकता हूँ, वायुमण्डल अच्छा हो तो साधन कर सकता हूँ इत्यादि। इन सब अनुकूलताओंकी चाहना न करना अर्थात् उनके अधीन न होना भी तप है। साधकको अपना साधन परिस्थितियोंके अधीन नहीं मानना चाहिये, प्रत्युत परिस्थितिके अनुसार अपना साधन बना लेना चाहिये। साधकको अपनी चेष्टा तो एकान्तमें साधन करनेकी करनी चाहिये, पर एकान्त न मिले तो मिली हुई परिस्थितिको भगवान्की भेजी हुई समझकर विशेष उत्साहसे प्रसन्नतापूर्वक साधनमें प्रवृत्ति होना चाहिये। 'आर्जवम्'-- सरलता, सीधेपनको आर्जव कहते हैं। यह सरलता साधकका विशेष गुण है। यदि साधक यह चाहता है कि दूसरे लोग मुझे अच्छा समझें, मेरा व्यवहार ठीक नहीं होगा तो लोग मुझे बढ़िया नहीं मानेंगे, इसलिये मुझे सरलतासे रहना चाहिये, तो यह एक प्रकारका कपट ही है। इसमें साधकमें बनावटीपन आता है, जब कि साधकमें सीधा, सरल भाव होना चाहिये। सीधा, सरल होनेके कारण लोग उसको मूर्ख, बेसमझ कह सकते हैं, पर उससे साधककी कोई हानि नहीं है। अपने उद्धारके लिये तो सरलता बड़े कामकी चीज है -- 'कपट गाँठ मन में नहीं, सबसों सरल सुभाव।' नारायन ता भक्त की, लगी किनारे नाव।। इसलिये साधकके शरीर, वाणी और मनके व्यवहारमें कोई बनावटीपन नहीं रहना चाहिये (टिप्पणी प0 793.2)। उसमें स्वाभाविक सीधापन हो।",

            "Hindi": "इस प्रथम श्लोक को पढ़ने से हमें उन अमानित्वादि बीस गुणों (जीवनादर्शों) का स्मरण होता है? जिन्हें क्षेत्राध्याय में भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण ने ज्ञान की संज्ञा प्रदान की थी। इस श्लोक में उन आदर्श गुणों की प्राय सम्पूर्ण सूची प्रस्तुत की गयी है? जो आध्यात्मिक जीवन जीने वाले एक सुसंस्कृत पुरुष में देखे जाते हैं। अपने व्यावहारिक जीवन में उन बीस गुणों को जीना ही आध्यात्मिक जीवन कहलाता है। भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण इन दैवी गुणों की गणना करते समय प्रथम स्थान अभय को देते हैं। भय अविद्या का लक्षण है। जहाँ विद्या है? वहाँ निर्भयता है। गुणों की इस सूची में अभय को प्रथम स्थान देकर गीताचार्य़ यह इंगित करते हैं कि किसी साधक की नैतिक पूर्णता उसके आध्यात्मिक विकास के समान अनुपात में होती है।अन्तकरण की शुद्धि अपने व्यक्तित्व के बाह्य स्तर पर साधक को कितना ही संयम क्यों न हो? फिर भी वह संयम उसे रचनात्मक और निश्चयात्मक शक्ति प्रदान नहीं कर सकता? जो कि नैतिक जीवन का सार है? मर्म है। गीता? सैद्धांतिक और व्यावहारिक इन दोनों ही दृष्टियों से एक शक्तिशाली धर्म का उपदेश देती है। निष्क्रिय सदाचार का पालन करने वाली आज्ञाकारी पीढ़ी से भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण सन्तुष्ट नहीं हैं। वे चाहते हैं कि समाज के सभी लोग न केवल अपने व्यक्तिगत जीवन में ही सर्वोच्च नैतिक मूल्यों को जियें? वरन् सामाजिक जीवन में भी धर्माचरण की ऐसी नवचेतना जाग्रत करें? जिससे मनुष्यों की सम्पूर्ण पीढ़ी ही सत्य और धर्म के प्रकाश से उज्वल बन जाये। धर्म शब्द के अर्थ में उद्देश्यों की सत्यता और साधनों की शुद्धता अन्तर्निहित है।ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थिति अत्यन्त देहासक्त और विषयासक्त पुरुष को उपर्युक्त अन्तकरण की शुद्धि प्राप्त नहीं हो सकती। आत्मा के दिव्य गान के साथ एकस्वर हुए मन में ही अपनी निम्न स्तर की वृत्तियों? बन्धनकारक आसक्तियों और निन्द्य उद्देश्यों को त्यागने की आवश्यक सार्मथ्य होती है। ये हीन वृत्तियां सदैव अन्तकरण में उभर कर सामने आती रहती हैं। ज्ञानयोग में दृढ़ स्थिति ही मन को निम्नस्तर के प्रलोभनों से निवृत्त करने का निश्चयात्मक उपाय है। यदि कोई बालक कांच की निर्मित नाजुक कलाकृति के साथ खेल रहा हो? तो उसके मातापिता? उस बहुमूल्य वस्तु की सुरक्षा के लिए? प्राय बालक को चॉकलेट आदि कोई वस्तु देते हैं और वह बालक उसे पान्ो के लिए उस कांच की मूल्यवान् वस्तु को त्याग देता है। इसी प्रकार? आत्मा के आनन्द को अनुभव करने वाले पुरुष इन्द्रियों के विषयों तथा तज्जनित क्षणिक सुखों में स्वभावत आसक्त नहीं होता।दान? दम (इन्द्रिय संयम) और यज्ञ ज्ञानयोग में दृढ़ स्थिति प्राप्त करने के ये तीन साधन हैं जिनके द्वारा एक साधक अन्तकरण की योग्यता प्राप्त कर सकता है। बहुलता के भाव से उत्पन्न हुई दान की प्रवृत्ति ही वास्तविक दान है। जब हम अन्यों के साथ एकत्व का अनुभव करते हैं? तभी हम सबके साथ अपने सर्वस्व का विभाजन करने के लिए तत्पर होते हैं? अन्यथा नहीं। इस प्रकार? दान का उदय हमारी इस क्षमता से होता है? जिसके द्वारा हम अपनी परिग्रह और लोभ की प्रवृत्ति को संयमित करते हैं। जहाँ इनका संयमन एक पक्ष है? तो दूसरा पक्ष है यज्ञ अर्थात् त्याग की भावना। यज्ञ भावना से प्रेरित होने पर ही हम अपने संग्रह का दान कर सकते हैं। दान शब्द से केवल धन या वस्तुओं का ही दान नहीं? वरन् दुखियों के साथ सहानुभूति का भाव तथा ज्ञानदान भी इसमें सम्मिलित है।यदि दान साधक के वैराग्य को विकसित करता है? जिससे वह साधक अपनी सम्पत्ति का विनियोग दीनजनों की सहायता में करता है? तो हम कह सकते हैं कि हमारे व्यक्तिगत जीवन में इन्द्रियसंयम (दम)? उसी यज्ञ भावना का संप्रयोग है। इन्द्रियों के विषयों में विचरण करने का पूर्ण अधिकार देने का अर्थ अपनी सम्पूर्ण शक्ति का निष्फल ही अपव्यय करना है। साधक को चाहिए कि अपनी इस शक्ति का उपयोग वह अपने ध्यानाभ्यास में करे। मन को आत्मा में समाहित करने के लिए सूक्ष्म शक्ति की आवश्यकता होती है और उसे साधक इन्द्रियसंयम के द्वारा अपने में ही निहित देख सकता है। दान और दम के बिना सत्य की तीर्थयात्रा मात्र स्वप्न ही है।यज्ञ वैदिककाल में यज्ञ शब्द का अर्थ श्रद्धायुक्त होमहवन आदि का अनुष्ठान समझा जाता था। उस काल में साधकगण इन यज्ञों का श्रद्धापूर्वक अनुष्ठान करते थे। पौराणिक काल में वैदिक कर्मकाण्ड का स्थान मूर्तिपूजा? प्रार्थना जैसी भक्ति साधनाओं ने ले लिया जो उसी रूप में आज भी विद्यमान हैं। यज्ञ अर्थात् पूजा के अनुष्ठान से मन को एक आलम्बन प्राप्त होने से इन्द्रियों का संयमन करने में सरलता होती है। उसी प्रकार? चित्त की शुद्धता भी प्राप्त होने से दान की भावना भी जागृत होती है। इन गुणों के होने से आत्मानुभूति सहज सिद्ध हो जाती है। इस प्रकार? इस श्लोक में यह ध्यान देने योग्य बात है कि प्रत्येक उत्तरोत्तर गुण अपने पूर्व के गुण से किस्ा प्रकार संबद्ध है।स्वाध्याय इस शब्द का पारम्परिक अर्थ है? वेदों का नित्य पठन तथा यथासंभव उसका अध्ययन भी करना। वेदों के नित्य? नियमित अध्ययन से हमें अपने व्यावहारिक जीवन में दैवी गुणों को जीने की प्रेरणा मिलती है। परन्तु? स्वाध्याय से मात्र वेदपठन या बौद्धिक स्तर पर उसके अर्थ को समझना ही पर्याप्त नहीं है। संस्कृत के इस शब्द का आशय है स्वयं का अध्ययन अर्थात् आत्मनिरीक्षण। वेदप्रतिपादित सत्यों को समझकर उनका स्वानुभवकरण ही वास्तविक स्वाध्याय है। स्वाध्याय और यज्ञ से हमें आत्मसंयम का जीवन जीने का साहस प्राप्त होगा? जो हमें अपने ध्यानाभ्यास में चित्त की स्थिरता प्रदान करेगा।तप शारीरिक स्तर पर पालन किये जाने वाले व्रत? उपवास आदि तप कहलाते हैं। तपाचरण से बाह्यजगत् के भोगों में व्यर्थ ही नष्ट होने वाली हमारी शक्ति का संचय होता है? जिसके सदुपयोग आत्मविकास के लिए किया जा सकता है।आर्जवम् इसका अर्थ है सरलता। बुद्धि के विचार? मन की भावनाओं और कर्मों में कुटिलता का साधक के व्यक्तित्व पर आत्मघातक परिणाम होता है। हमारे वास्तविक उद्देश्यों और प्रेरणाओं? निश्चय और आकांक्षाओं? विवेक और अनुभवों को असत्य सिद्ध करने वाले हमारे कर्मों का परिणाम अपने व्यक्तित्व की वक्रता होता है। जो व्यक्ति इस प्रकार का व्यक्तित्व जीता है? उसका जीवन दो भागों में विभाजित हो जाता है और शीघ्र ही वह अपनी कार्यकुशलता की आभा को खो देता है और व्यक्तिगत दृढ़ता की शक्ति की दृष्टि से भी दुर्बल हो जाता है।इस प्रकार? इस अध्याय के प्रथम श्लोक में ही? दैवीगुणों का उल्लेख करते हुए? उनके परस्पर संबंधों को भी दर्शाया गया है। हिन्दू धर्ण में वर्णित नैतिक मूल्य और सदाचार के नियम किसी कल्पनाकुशल सन्त या उदास देवदूत की स्वैच्छिक घोषणाएं नहीं हैं। विवेक और अनुभवों की दृढ़ चट्टानों की नींव पर उनका निर्णाण हुआ है। निष्ठापूर्वक उनका पालन करने और सजगतापूर्वक उन्हें जीने पर? वे हमारी प्राय सुप्त दैवी क्षमताओं को व्यक्त करने में अपना योगदान देते हैं। हिन्दू धर्म के अनुसार ये दैवी गुण अपने आप में स्वर्ग प्रवेश का अधिकार प्रदान नहीं कर सकते? परन्तु मनुष्य के हृदय में स्थित दिव्य आत्मतत्त्व को पूर्णतया उजागर करने म्ों वे पूर्ण तैयारी के रूप में सहायक होते हैं।और आगे कहते हैं",

            "Devnagri": "इस प्रथम श्लोक को पढ़ने से हमें उन अमानित्वादि बीस गुणों (जीवनादर्शों) का स्मरण होता है? जिन्हें क्षेत्राध्याय में भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण ने ज्ञान की संज्ञा प्रदान की थी। इस श्लोक में उन आदर्श गुणों की प्राय सम्पूर्ण सूची प्रस्तुत की गयी है? जो आध्यात्मिक जीवन जीने वाले एक सुसंस्कृत पुरुष में देखे जाते हैं। अपने व्यावहारिक जीवन में उन बीस गुणों को जीना ही आध्यात्मिक जीवन कहलाता है। भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण इन दैवी गुणों की गणना करते समय प्रथम स्थान अभय को देते हैं। भय अविद्या का लक्षण है। जहाँ विद्या है? वहाँ निर्भयता है। गुणों की इस सूची में अभय को प्रथम स्थान देकर गीताचार्य़ यह इंगित करते हैं कि किसी साधक की नैतिक पूर्णता उसके आध्यात्मिक विकास के समान अनुपात में होती है।अन्तकरण की शुद्धि अपने व्यक्तित्व के बाह्य स्तर पर साधक को कितना ही संयम क्यों न हो? फिर भी वह संयम उसे रचनात्मक और निश्चयात्मक शक्ति प्रदान नहीं कर सकता? जो कि नैतिक जीवन का सार है? मर्म है। गीता? सैद्धांतिक और व्यावहारिक इन दोनों ही दृष्टियों से एक शक्तिशाली धर्म का उपदेश देती है। निष्क्रिय सदाचार का पालन करने वाली आज्ञाकारी पीढ़ी से भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण सन्तुष्ट नहीं हैं। वे चाहते हैं कि समाज के सभी लोग न केवल अपने व्यक्तिगत जीवन में ही सर्वोच्च नैतिक मूल्यों को जियें? वरन् सामाजिक जीवन में भी धर्माचरण की ऐसी नवचेतना जाग्रत करें? जिससे मनुष्यों की सम्पूर्ण पीढ़ी ही सत्य और धर्म के प्रकाश से उज्वल बन जाये। धर्म शब्द के अर्थ में उद्देश्यों की सत्यता और साधनों की शुद्धता अन्तर्निहित है।ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थिति अत्यन्त देहासक्त और विषयासक्त पुरुष को उपर्युक्त अन्तकरण की शुद्धि प्राप्त नहीं हो सकती। आत्मा के दिव्य गान के साथ एकस्वर हुए मन में ही अपनी निम्न स्तर की वृत्तियों? बन्धनकारक आसक्तियों और निन्द्य उद्देश्यों को त्यागने की आवश्यक सार्मथ्य होती है। ये हीन वृत्तियां सदैव अन्तकरण में उभर कर सामने आती रहती हैं। ज्ञानयोग में दृढ़ स्थिति ही मन को निम्नस्तर के प्रलोभनों से निवृत्त करने का निश्चयात्मक उपाय है। यदि कोई बालक कांच की निर्मित नाजुक कलाकृति के साथ खेल रहा हो? तो उसके मातापिता? उस बहुमूल्य वस्तु की सुरक्षा के लिए? प्राय बालक को चॉकलेट आदि कोई वस्तु देते हैं और वह बालक उसे पान्ो के लिए उस कांच की मूल्यवान् वस्तु को त्याग देता है। इसी प्रकार? आत्मा के आनन्द को अनुभव करने वाले पुरुष इन्द्रियों के विषयों तथा तज्जनित क्षणिक सुखों में स्वभावत आसक्त नहीं होता।दान? दम (इन्द्रिय संयम) और यज्ञ ज्ञानयोग में दृढ़ स्थिति प्राप्त करने के ये तीन साधन हैं जिनके द्वारा एक साधक अन्तकरण की योग्यता प्राप्त कर सकता है। बहुलता के भाव से उत्पन्न हुई दान की प्रवृत्ति ही वास्तविक दान है। जब हम अन्यों के साथ एकत्व का अनुभव करते हैं? तभी हम सबके साथ अपने सर्वस्व का विभाजन करने के लिए तत्पर होते हैं? अन्यथा नहीं। इस प्रकार? दान का उदय हमारी इस क्षमता से होता है? जिसके द्वारा हम अपनी परिग्रह और लोभ की प्रवृत्ति को संयमित करते हैं। जहाँ इनका संयमन एक पक्ष है? तो दूसरा पक्ष है यज्ञ अर्थात् त्याग की भावना। यज्ञ भावना से प्रेरित होने पर ही हम अपने संग्रह का दान कर सकते हैं। दान शब्द से केवल धन या वस्तुओं का ही दान नहीं? वरन् दुखियों के साथ सहानुभूति का भाव तथा ज्ञानदान भी इसमें सम्मिलित है।यदि दान साधक के वैराग्य को विकसित करता है? जिससे वह साधक अपनी सम्पत्ति का विनियोग दीनजनों की सहायता में करता है? तो हम कह सकते हैं कि हमारे व्यक्तिगत जीवन में इन्द्रियसंयम (दम)? उसी यज्ञ भावना का संप्रयोग है। इन्द्रियों के विषयों में विचरण करने का पूर्ण अधिकार देने का अर्थ अपनी सम्पूर्ण शक्ति का निष्फल ही अपव्यय करना है। साधक को चाहिए कि अपनी इस शक्ति का उपयोग वह अपने ध्यानाभ्यास में करे। मन को आत्मा में समाहित करने के लिए सूक्ष्म शक्ति की आवश्यकता होती है और उसे साधक इन्द्रियसंयम के द्वारा अपने में ही निहित देख सकता है। दान और दम के बिना सत्य की तीर्थयात्रा मात्र स्वप्न ही है।यज्ञ वैदिककाल में यज्ञ शब्द का अर्थ श्रद्धायुक्त होमहवन आदि का अनुष्ठान समझा जाता था। उस काल में साधकगण इन यज्ञों का श्रद्धापूर्वक अनुष्ठान करते थे। पौराणिक काल में वैदिक कर्मकाण्ड का स्थान मूर्तिपूजा? प्रार्थना जैसी भक्ति साधनाओं ने ले लिया जो उसी रूप में आज भी विद्यमान हैं। यज्ञ अर्थात् पूजा के अनुष्ठान से मन को एक आलम्बन प्राप्त होने से इन्द्रियों का संयमन करने में सरलता होती है। उसी प्रकार? चित्त की शुद्धता भी प्राप्त होने से दान की भावना भी जागृत होती है। इन गुणों के होने से आत्मानुभूति सहज सिद्ध हो जाती है। इस प्रकार? इस श्लोक में यह ध्यान देने योग्य बात है कि प्रत्येक उत्तरोत्तर गुण अपने पूर्व के गुण से किस्ा प्रकार संबद्ध है।स्वाध्याय इस शब्द का पारम्परिक अर्थ है? वेदों का नित्य पठन तथा यथासंभव उसका अध्ययन भी करना। वेदों के नित्य? नियमित अध्ययन से हमें अपने व्यावहारिक जीवन में दैवी गुणों को जीने की प्रेरणा मिलती है। परन्तु? स्वाध्याय से मात्र वेदपठन या बौद्धिक स्तर पर उसके अर्थ को समझना ही पर्याप्त नहीं है। संस्कृत के इस शब्द का आशय है स्वयं का अध्ययन अर्थात् आत्मनिरीक्षण। वेदप्रतिपादित सत्यों को समझकर उनका स्वानुभवकरण ही वास्तविक स्वाध्याय है। स्वाध्याय और यज्ञ से हमें आत्मसंयम का जीवन जीने का साहस प्राप्त होगा? जो हमें अपने ध्यानाभ्यास में चित्त की स्थिरता प्रदान करेगा।तप शारीरिक स्तर पर पालन किये जाने वाले व्रत? उपवास आदि तप कहलाते हैं। तपाचरण से बाह्यजगत् के भोगों में व्यर्थ ही नष्ट होने वाली हमारी शक्ति का संचय होता है? जिसके सदुपयोग आत्मविकास के लिए किया जा सकता है।आर्जवम् इसका अर्थ है सरलता। बुद्धि के विचार? मन की भावनाओं और कर्मों में कुटिलता का साधक के व्यक्तित्व पर आत्मघातक परिणाम होता है। हमारे वास्तविक उद्देश्यों और प्रेरणाओं? निश्चय और आकांक्षाओं? विवेक और अनुभवों को असत्य सिद्ध करने वाले हमारे कर्मों का परिणाम अपने व्यक्तित्व की वक्रता होता है। जो व्यक्ति इस प्रकार का व्यक्तित्व जीता है? उसका जीवन दो भागों में विभाजित हो जाता है और शीघ्र ही वह अपनी कार्यकुशलता की आभा को खो देता है और व्यक्तिगत दृढ़ता की शक्ति की दृष्टि से भी दुर्बल हो जाता है।इस प्रकार? इस अध्याय के प्रथम श्लोक में ही? दैवीगुणों का उल्लेख करते हुए? उनके परस्पर संबंधों को भी दर्शाया गया है। हिन्दू धर्ण में वर्णित नैतिक मूल्य और सदाचार के नियम किसी कल्पनाकुशल सन्त या उदास देवदूत की स्वैच्छिक घोषणाएं नहीं हैं। विवेक और अनुभवों की दृढ़ चट्टानों की नींव पर उनका निर्णाण हुआ है। निष्ठापूर्वक उनका पालन करने और सजगतापूर्वक उन्हें जीने पर? वे हमारी प्राय सुप्त दैवी क्षमताओं को व्यक्त करने में अपना योगदान देते हैं। हिन्दू धर्म के अनुसार ये दैवी गुण अपने आप में स्वर्ग प्रवेश का अधिकार प्रदान नहीं कर सकते? परन्तु मनुष्य के हृदय में स्थित दिव्य आत्मतत्त्व को पूर्णतया उजागर करने म्ों वे पूर्ण तैयारी के रूप में सहायक होते हैं।और आगे कहते हैं",

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या--'अहिंसा'--शरीर, मन, वाणी, भाव आदिके द्वारा किसीका भी किसी प्रकारसे अनिष्ट न करनेको तथा अनिष्ट न चाहनेको 'अहिंसा' कहते हैं। वास्तवमें सर्वथा अहिंसा तब होती है, जब मनष्य संसारकी तरफसे विमुख होकर परमात्माकी तरफ ही चलता है। उसके द्वारा 'अहिंसा' का पालन स्वतः होता है। परन्तु जो रागपूर्वक, भोगबुद्धिसे भोगोंका सेवन करता है वह कभी सर्वथा अहिंसक नहीं हो सकता। वह अपना पतन तो करता ही है, जिन पदार्थों आदिको वह भोगता है, उनका भी नाश करता है।जो संसारके सीमित पदार्थोंको व्यक्तिगत (अपने) न होनेपर भी व्यक्तिगत मानकर सुखबुद्धिसे भोगता है, वह हिंसा ही करता है। कारण कि समष्टि संसारसे सेवाके लिये मिले हुए पदार्थ, वस्तु, व्यक्ति, आदिमेंसे किसीको भी अपने भोगके लिये व्यक्तिगत मानना हिंसा ही है। यदि मनुष्य समष्टि संसारसे मिली हुई वस्तु, पदार्थ, व्यक्ति आदिको संसारकी ही मानकर निर्ममतापूर्वक संसारकी सेवामें लगा दे, तो वह हिंसासे बच सकता है और वही अहिंसक हो सकता है। जो सुख और भोगबुद्धिसे भोगोंका सेवन करता है, उसको देखकर, जिनको वे भोगपदार्थ नहीं मिलते -- ऐसे अभावग्रस्तोंको दुःखसंताप होता है। यह उनकी हिंसा ही है क्योंकि भोगी व्यक्तिमें अपना स्वार्थ और सुखबुद्धि रहती है तथा दूसरोंके दुःखकी लापरवाही रहती है। परन्तु जो संतमहापुरुष केवल दूसरोंका हित करनेके लिये ही जीवननिर्वाह करते हैं, उनको देखकर किसीको दुःख हो भी जायगा, तो भी उनको हिंसा नहीं लगेगी क्योंकि वे भोगबुद्धिसे जीवननिर्वाह करते ही नहीं -- 'शारीरं केवलं कर्म कुर्वन्नाप्नोति किल्बिषम्' (गीता 4। 21)।केवल परमात्माकी ओर चलनेवालेके द्वारा हिंसा नहीं होती क्योंकि वह भोगबुद्धिसे पदार्थ आदिका सेवन नहीं करता। परमत्माकी ओर चलनेवाला साधक शरीर, मन, वाणीके द्वारा कभी किसीको दुःख नहीं पहुँचाता। यदि उसकी बाह्य क्रियाओँसे किसीको दुःख होता है, तो यह दुःख उसके खुदके स्वभावसे ही होता है। साधककी तो भीतरसे कभी किसीको किञ्चिन्मात्र भी दुःख देनेकी भावना नहीं होनी चाहिये। उसका भाव निरन्तर सबका हित करनेका होना चाहिये -- 'सर्वभूतहिते रताः'।साधककी साधानमें कोई बाधा डाल दे, तो उसे उसपर क्रोध नहीं आता और न उसके मनमें उसके अहितकी भावना (हिंसा) ही पैदा होती है। हाँ, परमात्माकी ओर चलनेमें बाधा पड़नेसे उसको दुःख हो सकता है, पर वह दुःख भी सांसारिक दुःखकी तरह नहीं होता। साधकको बाधा लगती है, तो वह भगवान्को पुकारता है कि हे नाथ! मेरी कहाँ भूल हुई, जिससे बाधा लग रही है ऐसा विचार करके उसे रोना आ सकता है; पर बाधा डालनेवालेके प्रति क्रोध, द्वेष नहीं हो सकता। बाधा लगनेपर साधकमें तत्परता और सावधानी आती है। यदि उसमें बाधा डालनेवालेके प्रति द्वेष होता है, तो जितने अंशमें द्वेषवृत्ति रहती है, उतने अंशमें तत्परताकी कमी है, अपने साधनका आग्रह है।साधककमें एक तत्परता होती है और एक आग्रह होता है। तत्परता होनेसे साधनमें रुचि रहती है और आग्रह होनेसे साधनमें राग होता है। रुचि होनेसे अपने साधनमें कहाँ-कहाँ कमी है, उसका ज्ञान होता है और उसे दूर करनेकी शक्ति आती है, तथा उसे दूर करनेकी चेष्टा भी होती है। परन्तु राग होनेसे साधनमें विघ्न डालनेवालेके साथ द्वेष होनेकी सम्भावना रहती है। वास्तवमें देखा जाय तो साधनमें हमारी रुचि कम होनेसे ही दूसरा हमारे साधनमें बाधा डालता है। अगर साधनमें हमारी रुचि कम न हो तो दूसरा हमारे साधनमें बाधा नहीं डालेगा, प्रत्युत यह सोचकर उपेक्षा कर देगा कि यह जिद्दी है, मानेगा नहीं अतः जैसा चाहे, वैसा करने दो।जैसे पुष्पसे सुगन्ध स्वतः फैलती है, ऐसे ही साधकसे स्वतः पारमार्थिक परमाणु फैलते हैं और वायुमण्डल शुद्ध होता है। इससे उसके द्वारा स्वतःस्वाभाविक प्राणिमात्रका बड़ा भारी उपकार एवं हित होता रहता है। परन्तु जो अपने दुर्गुणदुराचारोंके द्वारा वायुमण्डलको अशुद्ध करता रहता है, वह प्राणिमात्रकी हिंसा करनेका अपराधी होता है।'सत्यम्'-- अपने स्वार्थ और अभिमानका त्याग करके केवल दूसरोंके हितकी दृष्टिसे जैसा सुना, देखा, पढ़ा,समझा और निश्चय किया है, उससे न अधिक और न कम -- वैसाकावैसा प्रिय शब्दोंमें कह देना,सत्य है।सत्यस्वरूप परमात्माको पाने और जाननेका एकमात्र उद्देश्य हो जानेपर साधकके द्वारा मन, वाणी और क्रियासे असत्यव्यवहार नहीं हो सकता। उसके द्वारा सत्यव्यवहार, सबके हितका व्यवहार ही होता है। जो सत्यको जानना चाहता है, वह सत्यके ही सम्मुख रहता है। इसलिये उसके मनवाणीशरीरसे जो क्रियाएँ होती हैं, वे सभी उत्साहपूर्वक सत्यकी ओर चलनेके लिये ही होती हैं।'अक्रोधः'-- दूसरोंका अनिष्ट करनेके लिये अन्तःकरणमें जो जलनात्मक वृत्ति पैदा होती है, वह क्रोध है। पर जबतक अन्तःकरणमें दूसरोंका अनिष्ट करनेकी भावना पैदा नहीं होती, तबतक वह क्षोभ है, क्रोध नहीं।परमात्मप्राप्तिके उद्देश्यसे साधन करनेवाला मनुष्य अपना अपकार करनेवालेका भी अनिष्ट नहीं करना चाहता। वह इस बातको समझता है कि अनिष्ट करनेवाला व्यक्ति वास्तवमें हमारा अनिष्ट कभी कर ही नहीं सकता। यह जो हमे दुःख देनेके लिये आया है, यह हमने पहले कोई गलती की है, उसीका फल है। अतः यह हमें शुद्ध कर रहा है, निर्मल कर रहा है। जैसे, डॉक्टर किसी रुग्ण अङ्ग को काटता है, तो उसपर रोगी क्रोध नहीं करता, प्रत्युत उसे अच्छा मानता है, ठीक मानता है। उसके रुग्ण अङ्गको काटना तो उसे ठीक करनेके लिये ही है। ऐसे ही साधकको कोई अहितकी भावनासे किसी तरहसे दुःख देता है, तो उसमें यह भाव पैदा होता है कि वह मेरेको शुद्ध, निर्मल बनानेमें निमित्त बन रहा है अतः उसपर क्रोध कैसे वह तो मेरा उपकार कर रहा है और भविष्यके लिये सावधान कर रहा है कि जो गलती पहले की है, आगे वैसी गलती न करूँ।जो लोग साधकका हित करनेवाले हैं, उसकी सेवा करनेवाले हैं, वे तो साधकको सुख पहुँचाकर उसके पुण्योंका नाश करते हैं। पर साधकको उनपर (उसके पुण्योंका नाश करनेके कारण) क्रोध नहीं आता। उनपर साधकको यह विचार आता है कि वे जो मेरी सेवा करते हैं, मेरे अनुकूल आचरण करते हैं, यह तो उनकी सज्जनता है, उनका श्रेष्ठ भाव है। परन्तु पुण्योंका नाश तो तब होता है, जब मैं उनकी सेवासे सुख भोगता हूँ। इस प्रकार साधककी दृष्टि सेवा करनेवालोंकी अच्छाई, शुद्ध नीयतपर ही जाती है। अतः साधकको न तो दुःख देनेवालोंपर क्रोध होता है और न सुख देनेवालोंपर। 'त्यागः'-- संसारसे विमुख हो जाना ही असली त्याग है। साधकको जीवनमें बाहरका और भीतरका -- दोनोंका ही त्याग होना चाहिये। जैसे, बाहरसे पाप, अन्याय, अत्याचार, दुराचार आदिका और बाहरी सुखआराम आदिका त्याग भी करना चाहिये, और भीतरसे सांसारिक नाशवान् वस्तुओंकी कामनाका त्याग भी करना चाहिये। इससे भी बाहरके त्यागकी अपेक्षा भीतरकी कामनाका त्याग श्रेष्ठ है। कामनाका सर्वथा त्याग होनेपर तत्काल शान्तिकी प्राप्ति होती है -- 'त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम्' (गीता 12। 12)।साधकके लिये उत्पन्न और नष्ट होनेवाली वस्तुओंकी कामना ही वास्तवमें सबसे ज्यादा बाधक होती है। अतः,कामनाका सर्वथा त्याग करना चाहिये। त्याग कब होता है जब साधकका उद्देश्य एकमात्र परमात्मप्राप्तिका ही हो जाता है, तब उसकी कामनाएँ दूर होती चली जाती हैं। कारण कि सांसारिक भोग और संग्रह साधकका लक्ष्य नहीं होता। अतः वह सांसारिक भोग और संग्रहकी कामनाका त्याग करते हुए अपने साधनमें आगे बढ़ता रहता है।'शान्तिः' -- अन्तःकरणमें रागद्वेषजनित हलचलका न होना शान्ति है क्योंकि संसारके साथ रागद्वेष करनेसे ही अन्तःकरणमें अशान्ति आती है और उनके न होनेसे अन्तःकरण स्वाभाविक ही शान्त, प्रसन्न रहता है।अनुकूलतासे पुराने पुण्योंका नाश होता है और उसमें अपना स्वभाव सुधरनेकी अपेक्षा बिगड़नेकी सम्भावना अधिक रहती है। परन्तु प्रतिकूलता आनेपर पापोंका नाश होता है और स्वभावमें भी सुधार होता है। इस बातको समझनेपर प्रतिकूलतामें भी स्वतः शान्ति बनी रहती है।किसी परिस्थिति आदिको लेकर साधकमें कभी रागद्वेषका भाव हो भी जाता है तो उसके मनमें अशान्ति पैदा हो जाती है और अशान्ति होते ही वह तुरंत सावधान हो जाता है कि रागद्वेषपूर्वक कर्म करना मेरा उद्देश्य नहीं है। इस विचारसे फिर शान्ति आ जाती है और समय पाकर स्थिर हो जाती है।'अपैशुनम्'-- किसीके दोषको दूसरेके आगे प्रकट करके दूसरोंमें उसके प्रति दुर्भाव पैदा करना पिशुनता है और इसका सर्वथा अभाव ही अपैशुन है। परमात्मप्राप्तिका ही उद्देश्य होनेसे साधक कभी किसीकी चुगली नहीं करता। ज्यों-ज्यों उसका साधन आगे बढ़ता चला जाता है, त्यों-ही-त्यों उसकी दोषदृष्टि और द्वेषवृत्ति मिटकर दूसरोंके प्रति उसका स्वतः ही अच्छा भाव होता चला जाता है। उसके मनमें यह विचार भी नहीं आता कि मैं साधन करनेवाला हूँ और ये दूसरे (साधन न करनेवाले) साधारण मनुष्य हैं, प्रत्युत तत्परतासे साधन होनेपर उसे जैसी अपनी स्थिति (जडतासे सम्बन्ध न होना) दिखायी देती है, वैसी ही दूसरोंकी स्थिति भी दिखायी देती है कि वास्तवमें उनका भी जडतासे सम्बन्ध नहीं है, केवल सम्बन्ध माना हुआ है। इस तरह जब उसकी दृष्टिमें किसीका भी जडतासे सम्बन्ध है ही नहीं, तो वह किसीका दोष किसीके प्रति क्यों प्रकट करेगाभक्तिमार्गवाला सर्वत्र अपने प्रभुको देखता है, ज्ञानमार्गवाला केवल अपने स्वरूपको ही देखता है और कर्मयोगमार्गवाला अपने सेव्यको देखता है। इसलिये साधक किसीकी बुराई, निन्दा, चुगली आदि कर ही कैसे सकता है'दया भूतेषु'-- दूसरोंको दुःखी देखकर उनका दुःख दूर करनेकी भावनाको दया कहते हैं। भगवान्की, संतमहात्माओंकी, साधकोंकी और साधारण मनुष्योंकी दया अलगअलग होती है -- (1) 'भगवान्की दया'-- भगवान्की दया सभीको शुद्ध करनेके लिये होती है। भक्तलोग इस दयाके दो भेद मानते हैं -- कृपा और दया। मात्र मनुष्योंको पापोंसे शुद्ध करनेके लिये उनके मनके विरुद्ध (प्रतिकूल) परिस्थितिको भेजना कृपा है और अनुकूल परिस्थितिको भेजना दया है। (2) 'संतमहात्माओंकी दया'--संतमहात्मालोग दूसरोंके दुःखसे दुःखी और दूसरोंके सुखसे सुखी होते हैं -- 'पर दुख दुख सुख सुख देखे पर' (मानस 7। 38। 1)। पर वास्तवमें उनके भीतर न दूसरोंके दुःखसे दुःख होता है और न अपने दुःखसे ही दुःख होता है। अपनेपर प्रतिकूल परिस्थिति आनेपर वे उसमें भगवान्की कृपाको देखते हैं, पर दूसरोंपर दुःख आनेपर उन्हें सुखी करनेके लिये वे उनके दुःखको स्वयं अपनेपर ले लेते हैं। जैसे, इन्द्रने क्रोधपूर्वक बिना अपराधके दधीचि ऋषिका सिर काट दिया था, पर जब इन्द्रने अपनी रक्षाके लिये उनकी ह़ड्डियाँ माँगी, तब दधीचिने सहर्ष प्राण छोड़कर उन्हें अपनी हड्डियाँ दे दीं। इस प्रकार संतमहापुरुष दूसरेके दुःखको सह नहीं सकते, प्रत्युत उन्हें सुख पहुँचानेके लिये अपनी सुखसामग्री और प्राणतक दे देते हैं, चाहे दूसरा उनका अहित करनेवाला ही क्यों न हो (टिप्पणी प0 796) इसलिये संतमहात्माओंकी दया विशेष शुद्ध, निर्मल होती है। (3) 'साधकोंकी दया'--साधक अपने मनमें दूसरोंका दुःख दूर करनेकी भावना रखता है और उसके अनुसार उनका दुःख दूर करनेकी चेष्टा भी करता है। दूसरोंको दुःखी देखकर उसका हृदय द्रवित हो जाता है क्योंकि वह अपनी ही तरह दूसरोंके दुःखको भी समझता है। इसलिये उसका यह भाव रहता है कि सब सुखी कैसे हों सबका भला कैसे हो सबका उद्धार कैसे हो सबका हित कैसे हो अपनी ओरसे वह ऐसी ही चेष्टा करता है परन्तु मैं सबका हित करता हूँ, सबके हितकी चेष्टा करता हूँ -- इन बातोंको लेकर उसके मनमें अभिमान नहीं होता। कारण कि दूसरोंका दुःख दूर करनेका सहज स्वभाव बन जानेसे उसे अपने इस आचरणमें कोई विशेषता नहीं दीखती। इसलिये उसको अभिमान नहीं होता।जो प्राणी भगवान्की ओर नहीं चलते, दुर्गुणदुराचारोंमें रत रहते हैं, दूसरोंका अपराध करते हैं और अपना पतन करते हैं -- ऐसे मनुष्योंपर साधकको क्रोध न आकर दया आती है। इसलिये वह हरदम ऐसी चेष्टा करता रहता है कि ये लोग दुर्गुणदुराचारोंसे ऊपर कैसे उठें इनका भला कैसे हो कभीकभी वह उनके दोषोंको दूर करनेमें अपनेको निर्बल मानकर भगवान्से प्रार्थना करता है कि हे नाथ ये लोग इन दोषोंसे छूट जायँ और आपके भक्त बन जायँ।,(4) 'साधारण मनुष्योंकी दया'--साधारण मनुष्यकी दयामें थोड़ी मलिनता रहती है। वह किसी जीवके हितकी चेष्टा करता है, तो यह सोचता है कि मैं कितना दयालु हूँ मैंने इस जीवको सुख पहुँचाया, तो मैं कितना अच्छा हूँ हरके आदमी मेरेजैसा दयालु नहीं है, कोई-कोई ही होता है, इत्यादि। इस प्रकार लोग मुझे अच्छा समझेंगे, मेरा आदर करेंगे आदि बातोंको लेकर, अपनेमें महत्त्वबुद्धि रखकर जो दया की जाती है, उसमें दयाका अंश तो अच्छा है, पर साथमें उपर्युक्त मलिनताएँ रहनेसे उस दयामें अशुद्धि आ जाती है।इनसे भी साधारण दर्जेके मनुष्य दया तो करते हैं, पर उनकी दया ममतावाले व्यक्तियोंपर ही होती है। जैसे, ये हमारे परिवारके हैं, हमारे मत और सिद्धान्तको माननेवाले हैं, तो उनका दुःख दूर करनेकी इच्छासे उन्हें सुखआराम देनेका प्रयत्न करते हैं। यह दया ममता और पक्षपातयुक्त होनेसे अधिक अशुद्ध है।इनसे भी घटिया दर्जेके वे मनुष्य हैं, जो केवल अपने सुख और स्वार्थकी पूर्तिके लिये ही दूसरोंके प्रति दयाका बर्ताव करते हैं।'अलोलुप्त्वम्'--इन्द्रियोंका विषयोंसे सम्बन्ध होनेसे अथवा दूसरोंको भोग भोगते हुए देखनेसे मनका (भोग भोगनेके लिये) ललचा उठनेका नाम लोलुपता है और उसके सर्वथा अभावका नाम अलोलुप्त्व है। अलोलुपताके उपाय -- (1) साधकके लिये विशेष सावधानीकी बात है कि वह अपनी इन्द्रियोंसे भोगोंका सम्बन्ध न रखे और मनमें कभी भी ऐसा भाव, ऐसा अभिमान न आने दे कि मेरा इन्द्रियोंपर अधिकार है अर्थात् इन्द्रियाँ मेरे वशमें हैं अतः मेरा क्या बिगड़ सकता है (2) मैं हृदयसे परमात्माकी प्राप्ति चाहता हूँ, अगर कभी हृदयमें विषयलोलुपता हो गयी, तो मेरा पतन हो जायगा और मैं परमात्मासे विमुख हो जाऊँगा -- इस प्रकार साधक खूब सावधान रहे और कहीं अचानक विचलित होनेका अवसर आ जाय, तो हे नाथ बचाओ हे नाथ बचाओ ऐसे सच्चे हृदयसे भगवान्को पुकारे। (3) स्त्रीपुरुषोंकी तथा जन्तुओँकी कामविषयक चेष्ट न देखे। यदि दीख जाय, तो ऐसा विचार करे कि,यह तो बिलकुल चौरासी लाख योनियोंका रास्ता है। यह चीज तो मनुष्य, पुशपक्षी, कीटपतङ्ग, राक्षसअसुर, भूतप्रेत आदि मात्र जीवोंमें भी है। पर मैं तो चौरासी लाख योनियों अर्थात् जन्ममरणसे ऊँचा उठना चाहता हूँ। मैं जन्ममरणके मार्गका पथिक नहीं हूँ। मेरेको तो जन्म-मरणादि दुःखोंका अत्यन्त अभाव करके परमात्माकी प्राप्ति करना है। इस भावको बड़ी सावधानीके साथ जाग्रत् रखे और जहाँतक बने, ऐसी कामचेष्टा न देखे। 'मार्दवम्'--बिना कारण दुःख देनेवालों और वैर रखनेवालोंके प्रति भी अन्तःकरणमें कठोरताका भाव न होना तथा स्वाभाविक कोमलताका रहना मार्दव है (टिप्पणी प0 797)।साधकके हृदयमें सबके प्रति कोमलताका भाव रहता है। उसके प्रति कोई कठोरता एवं अहितका बर्ताव भी करता है, तो भी उसकी कोमलतामें अन्तर नहीं आता। यदि साधक कभी किसी बातको लेकर किसीको कठोर जवाब भी दे दे, तो वह कठोर जवाब भी उसके हितकी दृष्टिसे ही देता है। पर पीछे उसके मनमें यह विचार आता है कि मैंने उसके प्रति कठोरताका व्यवहार क्यों किया मैं प्रेमसे या अन्य किसी उपायसे भी समझा सकता था -- इस प्रकारके भाव आनेसे कठोरता मिटती रहती है और कोमलता बढ़ती रहती है।यद्यपि साधकोंके भावोंमें और वाणीमें कोमलता रहती है, तथापि उनकी भिन्न-भिन्न प्रकृति होनेसे सबकी वाणीमें एक समान कोमलता नहीं होती। परन्तु हृदयमें साधकोंका सबके प्रति कोमल भाव रहता है। ऐसे ही कर्मयोग, ज्ञानयोग और भक्तियोग आदिका साधन करनेवालोंके स्वभावमें विभिन्नता होनेसे उनके बर्ताव सबके प्रति भिन्न-भिन्न होते हैं अतः उनके आचरणोंमें एकजैसी कोमलता नहीं दीखती, पर भीतरमें बड़ी भारी कोमलता रहती है।'ह्रीः'--शास्त्र और लोकमर्यादाके विरुद्ध काम करनेमें जो एक संकोच होता है, उसका नाम 'ह्रीः' (लज्जा) है। साधकको साधनविरुद्ध क्रिया करनेमें लज्जा आती है। वह लज्जा केवल लोगोंके देखनेसे ही नहीं आती, प्रत्युत उसके मनमें अपनेआप ही यह विचार आता है कि रामराम, मैं ऐसी क्रिया कैसे कर सकता हूँ क्योंकि मैं तो परमात्माकी तरफ चलनेवाला (साधक) हूँ। लोग भी मुझे परमात्माकी तरफ चलनेवाला समझते हैं। अतः ऐसी साधनविरुद्ध क्रियाओँको मैं एकान्तमें अथवा लोगोंके सामने कैसे कर सकता हूँ -- इस लज्जाके कारण साधक बुरे कर्मोंसे बच जाता है एवं उसके आचरण ठीक होते चले जाते हैं। जब साधक अपनी अहंता बदल देता है कि मैं सेवक हूँ, मैं जिज्ञासु हूँ, मैं भक्त हूँ, तब उसे अपनी अहंताके विरुद्ध क्रिया करनेमें स्वाभाविक ही लज्जा आती है। इसलिये पारमार्थिक उद्देश्य रखनेवाले प्रत्येक साधकको अपनी अहंता मैं साधक हूँ, मैं सेवक हूँ, मैं जिज्ञासु हूँ, मैं भगवद्भक्त हूँ -- इस प्रकारसे यथारुचि बदल लेनी चाहिये, जिससे वह साधनविरोधी कर्मोंसे बचकर अपने उद्देश्यको जल्दी प्राप्त कर सकता है। 'अचापलम्'--कोई भी कार्य करनेमें चपलताका अर्थात् उतावलापनका न होना अचापल है। चपलता (चञ्चलता) होनेसे काम जल्दी होता है, ऐसी बात नहीं है। सात्त्विक मनुष्य सब काम धैर्यपूर्वक करता है अतः उसका काम सुचारुरूपसे और ठीक समयपर हो जाता है। जब कार्य ठीक हो जाता है, तब उसके अन्तःकरणमें हलचल, चिन्ता नहीं होती। चपलता न होनेसे कार्यमें दीर्घसूत्रताका दोष भी नहीं आता, प्रत्युत कार्यमें तत्परता आती है, जिससे सब काम सुचारुरूपसे होते हैं। अपने कर्तव्यकर्मोंको करनेके अतिरिक्त अन्य कोई इच्छा न होनेसे उसका चित्त विक्षिप्त और चञ्चल नहीं होता (गीता 18। 26)।",

            "Devnagri": "व्याख्या--'अहिंसा'--शरीर, मन, वाणी, भाव आदिके द्वारा किसीका भी किसी प्रकारसे अनिष्ट न करनेको तथा अनिष्ट न चाहनेको 'अहिंसा' कहते हैं। वास्तवमें सर्वथा अहिंसा तब होती है, जब मनष्य संसारकी तरफसे विमुख होकर परमात्माकी तरफ ही चलता है। उसके द्वारा 'अहिंसा' का पालन स्वतः होता है। परन्तु जो रागपूर्वक, भोगबुद्धिसे भोगोंका सेवन करता है वह कभी सर्वथा अहिंसक नहीं हो सकता। वह अपना पतन तो करता ही है, जिन पदार्थों आदिको वह भोगता है, उनका भी नाश करता है।जो संसारके सीमित पदार्थोंको व्यक्तिगत (अपने) न होनेपर भी व्यक्तिगत मानकर सुखबुद्धिसे भोगता है, वह हिंसा ही करता है। कारण कि समष्टि संसारसे सेवाके लिये मिले हुए पदार्थ, वस्तु, व्यक्ति, आदिमेंसे किसीको भी अपने भोगके लिये व्यक्तिगत मानना हिंसा ही है। यदि मनुष्य समष्टि संसारसे मिली हुई वस्तु, पदार्थ, व्यक्ति आदिको संसारकी ही मानकर निर्ममतापूर्वक संसारकी सेवामें लगा दे, तो वह हिंसासे बच सकता है और वही अहिंसक हो सकता है। जो सुख और भोगबुद्धिसे भोगोंका सेवन करता है, उसको देखकर, जिनको वे भोगपदार्थ नहीं मिलते -- ऐसे अभावग्रस्तोंको दुःखसंताप होता है। यह उनकी हिंसा ही है क्योंकि भोगी व्यक्तिमें अपना स्वार्थ और सुखबुद्धि रहती है तथा दूसरोंके दुःखकी लापरवाही रहती है। परन्तु जो संतमहापुरुष केवल दूसरोंका हित करनेके लिये ही जीवननिर्वाह करते हैं, उनको देखकर किसीको दुःख हो भी जायगा, तो भी उनको हिंसा नहीं लगेगी क्योंकि वे भोगबुद्धिसे जीवननिर्वाह करते ही नहीं -- 'शारीरं केवलं कर्म कुर्वन्नाप्नोति किल्बिषम्' (गीता 4। 21)।केवल परमात्माकी ओर चलनेवालेके द्वारा हिंसा नहीं होती क्योंकि वह भोगबुद्धिसे पदार्थ आदिका सेवन नहीं करता। परमत्माकी ओर चलनेवाला साधक शरीर, मन, वाणीके द्वारा कभी किसीको दुःख नहीं पहुँचाता। यदि उसकी बाह्य क्रियाओँसे किसीको दुःख होता है, तो यह दुःख उसके खुदके स्वभावसे ही होता है। साधककी तो भीतरसे कभी किसीको किञ्चिन्मात्र भी दुःख देनेकी भावना नहीं होनी चाहिये। उसका भाव निरन्तर सबका हित करनेका होना चाहिये -- 'सर्वभूतहिते रताः'।साधककी साधानमें कोई बाधा डाल दे, तो उसे उसपर क्रोध नहीं आता और न उसके मनमें उसके अहितकी भावना (हिंसा) ही पैदा होती है। हाँ, परमात्माकी ओर चलनेमें बाधा पड़नेसे उसको दुःख हो सकता है, पर वह दुःख भी सांसारिक दुःखकी तरह नहीं होता। साधकको बाधा लगती है, तो वह भगवान्को पुकारता है कि हे नाथ! मेरी कहाँ भूल हुई, जिससे बाधा लग रही है ऐसा विचार करके उसे रोना आ सकता है; पर बाधा डालनेवालेके प्रति क्रोध, द्वेष नहीं हो सकता। बाधा लगनेपर साधकमें तत्परता और सावधानी आती है। यदि उसमें बाधा डालनेवालेके प्रति द्वेष होता है, तो जितने अंशमें द्वेषवृत्ति रहती है, उतने अंशमें तत्परताकी कमी है, अपने साधनका आग्रह है।साधककमें एक तत्परता होती है और एक आग्रह होता है। तत्परता होनेसे साधनमें रुचि रहती है और आग्रह होनेसे साधनमें राग होता है। रुचि होनेसे अपने साधनमें कहाँ-कहाँ कमी है, उसका ज्ञान होता है और उसे दूर करनेकी शक्ति आती है, तथा उसे दूर करनेकी चेष्टा भी होती है। परन्तु राग होनेसे साधनमें विघ्न डालनेवालेके साथ द्वेष होनेकी सम्भावना रहती है। वास्तवमें देखा जाय तो साधनमें हमारी रुचि कम होनेसे ही दूसरा हमारे साधनमें बाधा डालता है। अगर साधनमें हमारी रुचि कम न हो तो दूसरा हमारे साधनमें बाधा नहीं डालेगा, प्रत्युत यह सोचकर उपेक्षा कर देगा कि यह जिद्दी है, मानेगा नहीं अतः जैसा चाहे, वैसा करने दो।जैसे पुष्पसे सुगन्ध स्वतः फैलती है, ऐसे ही साधकसे स्वतः पारमार्थिक परमाणु फैलते हैं और वायुमण्डल शुद्ध होता है। इससे उसके द्वारा स्वतःस्वाभाविक प्राणिमात्रका बड़ा भारी उपकार एवं हित होता रहता है। परन्तु जो अपने दुर्गुणदुराचारोंके द्वारा वायुमण्डलको अशुद्ध करता रहता है, वह प्राणिमात्रकी हिंसा करनेका अपराधी होता है।'सत्यम्'-- अपने स्वार्थ और अभिमानका त्याग करके केवल दूसरोंके हितकी दृष्टिसे जैसा सुना, देखा, पढ़ा,समझा और निश्चय किया है, उससे न अधिक और न कम -- वैसाकावैसा प्रिय शब्दोंमें कह देना,सत्य है।सत्यस्वरूप परमात्माको पाने और जाननेका एकमात्र उद्देश्य हो जानेपर साधकके द्वारा मन, वाणी और क्रियासे असत्यव्यवहार नहीं हो सकता। उसके द्वारा सत्यव्यवहार, सबके हितका व्यवहार ही होता है। जो सत्यको जानना चाहता है, वह सत्यके ही सम्मुख रहता है। इसलिये उसके मनवाणीशरीरसे जो क्रियाएँ होती हैं, वे सभी उत्साहपूर्वक सत्यकी ओर चलनेके लिये ही होती हैं।'अक्रोधः'-- दूसरोंका अनिष्ट करनेके लिये अन्तःकरणमें जो जलनात्मक वृत्ति पैदा होती है, वह क्रोध है। पर जबतक अन्तःकरणमें दूसरोंका अनिष्ट करनेकी भावना पैदा नहीं होती, तबतक वह क्षोभ है, क्रोध नहीं।परमात्मप्राप्तिके उद्देश्यसे साधन करनेवाला मनुष्य अपना अपकार करनेवालेका भी अनिष्ट नहीं करना चाहता। वह इस बातको समझता है कि अनिष्ट करनेवाला व्यक्ति वास्तवमें हमारा अनिष्ट कभी कर ही नहीं सकता। यह जो हमे दुःख देनेके लिये आया है, यह हमने पहले कोई गलती की है, उसीका फल है। अतः यह हमें शुद्ध कर रहा है, निर्मल कर रहा है। जैसे, डॉक्टर किसी रुग्ण अङ्ग को काटता है, तो उसपर रोगी क्रोध नहीं करता, प्रत्युत उसे अच्छा मानता है, ठीक मानता है। उसके रुग्ण अङ्गको काटना तो उसे ठीक करनेके लिये ही है। ऐसे ही साधकको कोई अहितकी भावनासे किसी तरहसे दुःख देता है, तो उसमें यह भाव पैदा होता है कि वह मेरेको शुद्ध, निर्मल बनानेमें निमित्त बन रहा है अतः उसपर क्रोध कैसे वह तो मेरा उपकार कर रहा है और भविष्यके लिये सावधान कर रहा है कि जो गलती पहले की है, आगे वैसी गलती न करूँ।जो लोग साधकका हित करनेवाले हैं, उसकी सेवा करनेवाले हैं, वे तो साधकको सुख पहुँचाकर उसके पुण्योंका नाश करते हैं। पर साधकको उनपर (उसके पुण्योंका नाश करनेके कारण) क्रोध नहीं आता। उनपर साधकको यह विचार आता है कि वे जो मेरी सेवा करते हैं, मेरे अनुकूल आचरण करते हैं, यह तो उनकी सज्जनता है, उनका श्रेष्ठ भाव है। परन्तु पुण्योंका नाश तो तब होता है, जब मैं उनकी सेवासे सुख भोगता हूँ। इस प्रकार साधककी दृष्टि सेवा करनेवालोंकी अच्छाई, शुद्ध नीयतपर ही जाती है। अतः साधकको न तो दुःख देनेवालोंपर क्रोध होता है और न सुख देनेवालोंपर। 'त्यागः'-- संसारसे विमुख हो जाना ही असली त्याग है। साधकको जीवनमें बाहरका और भीतरका -- दोनोंका ही त्याग होना चाहिये। जैसे, बाहरसे पाप, अन्याय, अत्याचार, दुराचार आदिका और बाहरी सुखआराम आदिका त्याग भी करना चाहिये, और भीतरसे सांसारिक नाशवान् वस्तुओंकी कामनाका त्याग भी करना चाहिये। इससे भी बाहरके त्यागकी अपेक्षा भीतरकी कामनाका त्याग श्रेष्ठ है। कामनाका सर्वथा त्याग होनेपर तत्काल शान्तिकी प्राप्ति होती है -- 'त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम्' (गीता 12। 12)।साधकके लिये उत्पन्न और नष्ट होनेवाली वस्तुओंकी कामना ही वास्तवमें सबसे ज्यादा बाधक होती है। अतः,कामनाका सर्वथा त्याग करना चाहिये। त्याग कब होता है जब साधकका उद्देश्य एकमात्र परमात्मप्राप्तिका ही हो जाता है, तब उसकी कामनाएँ दूर होती चली जाती हैं। कारण कि सांसारिक भोग और संग्रह साधकका लक्ष्य नहीं होता। अतः वह सांसारिक भोग और संग्रहकी कामनाका त्याग करते हुए अपने साधनमें आगे बढ़ता रहता है।'शान्तिः' -- अन्तःकरणमें रागद्वेषजनित हलचलका न होना शान्ति है क्योंकि संसारके साथ रागद्वेष करनेसे ही अन्तःकरणमें अशान्ति आती है और उनके न होनेसे अन्तःकरण स्वाभाविक ही शान्त, प्रसन्न रहता है।अनुकूलतासे पुराने पुण्योंका नाश होता है और उसमें अपना स्वभाव सुधरनेकी अपेक्षा बिगड़नेकी सम्भावना अधिक रहती है। परन्तु प्रतिकूलता आनेपर पापोंका नाश होता है और स्वभावमें भी सुधार होता है। इस बातको समझनेपर प्रतिकूलतामें भी स्वतः शान्ति बनी रहती है।किसी परिस्थिति आदिको लेकर साधकमें कभी रागद्वेषका भाव हो भी जाता है तो उसके मनमें अशान्ति पैदा हो जाती है और अशान्ति होते ही वह तुरंत सावधान हो जाता है कि रागद्वेषपूर्वक कर्म करना मेरा उद्देश्य नहीं है। इस विचारसे फिर शान्ति आ जाती है और समय पाकर स्थिर हो जाती है।'अपैशुनम्'-- किसीके दोषको दूसरेके आगे प्रकट करके दूसरोंमें उसके प्रति दुर्भाव पैदा करना पिशुनता है और इसका सर्वथा अभाव ही अपैशुन है। परमात्मप्राप्तिका ही उद्देश्य होनेसे साधक कभी किसीकी चुगली नहीं करता। ज्यों-ज्यों उसका साधन आगे बढ़ता चला जाता है, त्यों-ही-त्यों उसकी दोषदृष्टि और द्वेषवृत्ति मिटकर दूसरोंके प्रति उसका स्वतः ही अच्छा भाव होता चला जाता है। उसके मनमें यह विचार भी नहीं आता कि मैं साधन करनेवाला हूँ और ये दूसरे (साधन न करनेवाले) साधारण मनुष्य हैं, प्रत्युत तत्परतासे साधन होनेपर उसे जैसी अपनी स्थिति (जडतासे सम्बन्ध न होना) दिखायी देती है, वैसी ही दूसरोंकी स्थिति भी दिखायी देती है कि वास्तवमें उनका भी जडतासे सम्बन्ध नहीं है, केवल सम्बन्ध माना हुआ है। इस तरह जब उसकी दृष्टिमें किसीका भी जडतासे सम्बन्ध है ही नहीं, तो वह किसीका दोष किसीके प्रति क्यों प्रकट करेगाभक्तिमार्गवाला सर्वत्र अपने प्रभुको देखता है, ज्ञानमार्गवाला केवल अपने स्वरूपको ही देखता है और कर्मयोगमार्गवाला अपने सेव्यको देखता है। इसलिये साधक किसीकी बुराई, निन्दा, चुगली आदि कर ही कैसे सकता है'दया भूतेषु'-- दूसरोंको दुःखी देखकर उनका दुःख दूर करनेकी भावनाको दया कहते हैं। भगवान्की, संतमहात्माओंकी, साधकोंकी और साधारण मनुष्योंकी दया अलगअलग होती है -- (1) 'भगवान्की दया'-- भगवान्की दया सभीको शुद्ध करनेके लिये होती है। भक्तलोग इस दयाके दो भेद मानते हैं -- कृपा और दया। मात्र मनुष्योंको पापोंसे शुद्ध करनेके लिये उनके मनके विरुद्ध (प्रतिकूल) परिस्थितिको भेजना कृपा है और अनुकूल परिस्थितिको भेजना दया है। (2) 'संतमहात्माओंकी दया'--संतमहात्मालोग दूसरोंके दुःखसे दुःखी और दूसरोंके सुखसे सुखी होते हैं -- 'पर दुख दुख सुख सुख देखे पर' (मानस 7। 38। 1)। पर वास्तवमें उनके भीतर न दूसरोंके दुःखसे दुःख होता है और न अपने दुःखसे ही दुःख होता है। अपनेपर प्रतिकूल परिस्थिति आनेपर वे उसमें भगवान्की कृपाको देखते हैं, पर दूसरोंपर दुःख आनेपर उन्हें सुखी करनेके लिये वे उनके दुःखको स्वयं अपनेपर ले लेते हैं। जैसे, इन्द्रने क्रोधपूर्वक बिना अपराधके दधीचि ऋषिका सिर काट दिया था, पर जब इन्द्रने अपनी रक्षाके लिये उनकी ह़ड्डियाँ माँगी, तब दधीचिने सहर्ष प्राण छोड़कर उन्हें अपनी हड्डियाँ दे दीं। इस प्रकार संतमहापुरुष दूसरेके दुःखको सह नहीं सकते, प्रत्युत उन्हें सुख पहुँचानेके लिये अपनी सुखसामग्री और प्राणतक दे देते हैं, चाहे दूसरा उनका अहित करनेवाला ही क्यों न हो (टिप्पणी प0 796) इसलिये संतमहात्माओंकी दया विशेष शुद्ध, निर्मल होती है। (3) 'साधकोंकी दया'--साधक अपने मनमें दूसरोंका दुःख दूर करनेकी भावना रखता है और उसके अनुसार उनका दुःख दूर करनेकी चेष्टा भी करता है। दूसरोंको दुःखी देखकर उसका हृदय द्रवित हो जाता है क्योंकि वह अपनी ही तरह दूसरोंके दुःखको भी समझता है। इसलिये उसका यह भाव रहता है कि सब सुखी कैसे हों सबका भला कैसे हो सबका उद्धार कैसे हो सबका हित कैसे हो अपनी ओरसे वह ऐसी ही चेष्टा करता है परन्तु मैं सबका हित करता हूँ, सबके हितकी चेष्टा करता हूँ -- इन बातोंको लेकर उसके मनमें अभिमान नहीं होता। कारण कि दूसरोंका दुःख दूर करनेका सहज स्वभाव बन जानेसे उसे अपने इस आचरणमें कोई विशेषता नहीं दीखती। इसलिये उसको अभिमान नहीं होता।जो प्राणी भगवान्की ओर नहीं चलते, दुर्गुणदुराचारोंमें रत रहते हैं, दूसरोंका अपराध करते हैं और अपना पतन करते हैं -- ऐसे मनुष्योंपर साधकको क्रोध न आकर दया आती है। इसलिये वह हरदम ऐसी चेष्टा करता रहता है कि ये लोग दुर्गुणदुराचारोंसे ऊपर कैसे उठें इनका भला कैसे हो कभीकभी वह उनके दोषोंको दूर करनेमें अपनेको निर्बल मानकर भगवान्से प्रार्थना करता है कि हे नाथ ये लोग इन दोषोंसे छूट जायँ और आपके भक्त बन जायँ।,(4) 'साधारण मनुष्योंकी दया'--साधारण मनुष्यकी दयामें थोड़ी मलिनता रहती है। वह किसी जीवके हितकी चेष्टा करता है, तो यह सोचता है कि मैं कितना दयालु हूँ मैंने इस जीवको सुख पहुँचाया, तो मैं कितना अच्छा हूँ हरके आदमी मेरेजैसा दयालु नहीं है, कोई-कोई ही होता है, इत्यादि। इस प्रकार लोग मुझे अच्छा समझेंगे, मेरा आदर करेंगे आदि बातोंको लेकर, अपनेमें महत्त्वबुद्धि रखकर जो दया की जाती है, उसमें दयाका अंश तो अच्छा है, पर साथमें उपर्युक्त मलिनताएँ रहनेसे उस दयामें अशुद्धि आ जाती है।इनसे भी साधारण दर्जेके मनुष्य दया तो करते हैं, पर उनकी दया ममतावाले व्यक्तियोंपर ही होती है। जैसे, ये हमारे परिवारके हैं, हमारे मत और सिद्धान्तको माननेवाले हैं, तो उनका दुःख दूर करनेकी इच्छासे उन्हें सुखआराम देनेका प्रयत्न करते हैं। यह दया ममता और पक्षपातयुक्त होनेसे अधिक अशुद्ध है।इनसे भी घटिया दर्जेके वे मनुष्य हैं, जो केवल अपने सुख और स्वार्थकी पूर्तिके लिये ही दूसरोंके प्रति दयाका बर्ताव करते हैं।'अलोलुप्त्वम्'--इन्द्रियोंका विषयोंसे सम्बन्ध होनेसे अथवा दूसरोंको भोग भोगते हुए देखनेसे मनका (भोग भोगनेके लिये) ललचा उठनेका नाम लोलुपता है और उसके सर्वथा अभावका नाम अलोलुप्त्व है। अलोलुपताके उपाय -- (1) साधकके लिये विशेष सावधानीकी बात है कि वह अपनी इन्द्रियोंसे भोगोंका सम्बन्ध न रखे और मनमें कभी भी ऐसा भाव, ऐसा अभिमान न आने दे कि मेरा इन्द्रियोंपर अधिकार है अर्थात् इन्द्रियाँ मेरे वशमें हैं अतः मेरा क्या बिगड़ सकता है (2) मैं हृदयसे परमात्माकी प्राप्ति चाहता हूँ, अगर कभी हृदयमें विषयलोलुपता हो गयी, तो मेरा पतन हो जायगा और मैं परमात्मासे विमुख हो जाऊँगा -- इस प्रकार साधक खूब सावधान रहे और कहीं अचानक विचलित होनेका अवसर आ जाय, तो हे नाथ बचाओ हे नाथ बचाओ ऐसे सच्चे हृदयसे भगवान्को पुकारे। (3) स्त्रीपुरुषोंकी तथा जन्तुओँकी कामविषयक चेष्ट न देखे। यदि दीख जाय, तो ऐसा विचार करे कि,यह तो बिलकुल चौरासी लाख योनियोंका रास्ता है। यह चीज तो मनुष्य, पुशपक्षी, कीटपतङ्ग, राक्षसअसुर, भूतप्रेत आदि मात्र जीवोंमें भी है। पर मैं तो चौरासी लाख योनियों अर्थात् जन्ममरणसे ऊँचा उठना चाहता हूँ। मैं जन्ममरणके मार्गका पथिक नहीं हूँ। मेरेको तो जन्म-मरणादि दुःखोंका अत्यन्त अभाव करके परमात्माकी प्राप्ति करना है। इस भावको बड़ी सावधानीके साथ जाग्रत् रखे और जहाँतक बने, ऐसी कामचेष्टा न देखे। 'मार्दवम्'--बिना कारण दुःख देनेवालों और वैर रखनेवालोंके प्रति भी अन्तःकरणमें कठोरताका भाव न होना तथा स्वाभाविक कोमलताका रहना मार्दव है (टिप्पणी प0 797)।साधकके हृदयमें सबके प्रति कोमलताका भाव रहता है। उसके प्रति कोई कठोरता एवं अहितका बर्ताव भी करता है, तो भी उसकी कोमलतामें अन्तर नहीं आता। यदि साधक कभी किसी बातको लेकर किसीको कठोर जवाब भी दे दे, तो वह कठोर जवाब भी उसके हितकी दृष्टिसे ही देता है। पर पीछे उसके मनमें यह विचार आता है कि मैंने उसके प्रति कठोरताका व्यवहार क्यों किया मैं प्रेमसे या अन्य किसी उपायसे भी समझा सकता था -- इस प्रकारके भाव आनेसे कठोरता मिटती रहती है और कोमलता बढ़ती रहती है।यद्यपि साधकोंके भावोंमें और वाणीमें कोमलता रहती है, तथापि उनकी भिन्न-भिन्न प्रकृति होनेसे सबकी वाणीमें एक समान कोमलता नहीं होती। परन्तु हृदयमें साधकोंका सबके प्रति कोमल भाव रहता है। ऐसे ही कर्मयोग, ज्ञानयोग और भक्तियोग आदिका साधन करनेवालोंके स्वभावमें विभिन्नता होनेसे उनके बर्ताव सबके प्रति भिन्न-भिन्न होते हैं अतः उनके आचरणोंमें एकजैसी कोमलता नहीं दीखती, पर भीतरमें बड़ी भारी कोमलता रहती है।'ह्रीः'--शास्त्र और लोकमर्यादाके विरुद्ध काम करनेमें जो एक संकोच होता है, उसका नाम 'ह्रीः' (लज्जा) है। साधकको साधनविरुद्ध क्रिया करनेमें लज्जा आती है। वह लज्जा केवल लोगोंके देखनेसे ही नहीं आती, प्रत्युत उसके मनमें अपनेआप ही यह विचार आता है कि रामराम, मैं ऐसी क्रिया कैसे कर सकता हूँ क्योंकि मैं तो परमात्माकी तरफ चलनेवाला (साधक) हूँ। लोग भी मुझे परमात्माकी तरफ चलनेवाला समझते हैं। अतः ऐसी साधनविरुद्ध क्रियाओँको मैं एकान्तमें अथवा लोगोंके सामने कैसे कर सकता हूँ -- इस लज्जाके कारण साधक बुरे कर्मोंसे बच जाता है एवं उसके आचरण ठीक होते चले जाते हैं। जब साधक अपनी अहंता बदल देता है कि मैं सेवक हूँ, मैं जिज्ञासु हूँ, मैं भक्त हूँ, तब उसे अपनी अहंताके विरुद्ध क्रिया करनेमें स्वाभाविक ही लज्जा आती है। इसलिये पारमार्थिक उद्देश्य रखनेवाले प्रत्येक साधकको अपनी अहंता मैं साधक हूँ, मैं सेवक हूँ, मैं जिज्ञासु हूँ, मैं भगवद्भक्त हूँ -- इस प्रकारसे यथारुचि बदल लेनी चाहिये, जिससे वह साधनविरोधी कर्मोंसे बचकर अपने उद्देश्यको जल्दी प्राप्त कर सकता है। 'अचापलम्'--कोई भी कार्य करनेमें चपलताका अर्थात् उतावलापनका न होना अचापल है। चपलता (चञ्चलता) होनेसे काम जल्दी होता है, ऐसी बात नहीं है। सात्त्विक मनुष्य सब काम धैर्यपूर्वक करता है अतः उसका काम सुचारुरूपसे और ठीक समयपर हो जाता है। जब कार्य ठीक हो जाता है, तब उसके अन्तःकरणमें हलचल, चिन्ता नहीं होती। चपलता न होनेसे कार्यमें दीर्घसूत्रताका दोष भी नहीं आता, प्रत्युत कार्यमें तत्परता आती है, जिससे सब काम सुचारुरूपसे होते हैं। अपने कर्तव्यकर्मोंको करनेके अतिरिक्त अन्य कोई इच्छा न होनेसे उसका चित्त विक्षिप्त और चञ्चल नहीं होता (गीता 18। 26)।",

            "Hindi": "अहिंसा प्राणियों को पीड़ा न पहुँचाना अहिंसा है। स्वार्थ या द्वेषवशात् किसी को पीड़ित करना हिंसा है। अहिंसा का पालन शरीर? वाणी और मन इन तीनों स्तर पर होना चाहिए। कभीकभी बाह्यदृष्टि से कोई व्यक्ति शरीर को पीड़ा पहुँचाते हुए दिखाई देता है? जैसे एक शल्य चिकित्सक रोगी की चिकित्सा करते हुऐ? उसे पीड़ा देता है किन्तु वह हिंसा नहीं मानी जाती। वैसे भी शारीरिक स्तर पर सम्पूर्ण अहिंसा संभव नहीं हो सकती है? किन्तु मन में कदापि हिंसा का भाव नहीं होना चाहिए। चिकित्सक के मन में इस हिंसा का भाव न होने से उसके द्वारा की गई शल्य चिकित्सा को हिंसा नहीं कहा जाता।सत्यम् सत्य का कुछ भाव आर्जव शब्द की व्याख्या में प्रकट किया जा चुका है। प्रमाणों से सिद्ध अर्थ को उसी रूप में प्रकट करना सत्य कहलाता है।अक्रोध यहाँ इस शब्द का क्रोध का सर्वथा अभाव अर्थ अभिप्रेत नहीं है। साधना की स्थिति में कभीकभी किसी घटना अथवा किसी के दुर्व्यवहार से मन में क्रोध आ जाता है? परन्तु तत्काल ही उसे पहचान कर उसका उपशमन करने की क्षमता को यहाँ अक्रोध कहा गया है। साधक को यह प्रयत्न करना चाहिए कि वह भी अपने क्रोध को क्रियारूप में व्यक्त न होने दे। इसी प्रकार की अन्य वृत्तियों का उपशमन करने की सार्मथ्य साधक को सम्पादित करनी चाहिए।त्याग यहाँ अहंकार और स्वार्थ का त्याग करने के लिए कहा गया है। पूर्व श्लोक के समान यहाँ उल्लिखित गुणों में भी परस्पर संबंध है। त्याग के अभाव में अक्रोध भी सिद्ध नहीं हो सकता? क्योंकि जब कोई हमारे अहंकार या स्वार्थ को चोट या हानि पहुंचाता है? तभी हमें क्रोध आता है।शान्ति उपर्युक्त गुणों से सम्पन्न व्यक्ति के मन में विक्षेपों का कोई कारण नहीं रह जाता? इसलिए उसके मन की शान्ति बनी रहती है। बाह्य जगत् की अथवा उसके व्यक्तिगत जीवन की परिस्थितियां कितनी ही दुखदायक और आक्रामक क्यों न हों? उस व्यक्ति का मनसन्तुलन कभी विचलित नहीं होता है।अपैशुनम् किसी व्यक्ति के दोषों को अन्य लोगों के समक्ष प्रकट करने को पैशुन कहते हैं। पैशुन का अभाव ही अपैशुन है। वाणी की मधुरता या कर्कशता वक्ता के व्यक्तित्व पर निर्भर करती है। एक अयुक्त (अर्थात् अशुद्ध अन्तकरण वाले) पुरुष को अन्य लोगों की द्वेषयुक्त निन्दा करने में एक प्रकार का आसुरी आनन्द प्राप्त होता है। प्राय यह कोमल और मांसल जिह्वा ही किसी विनाशकारी अस्त्र से भी अधिक विध्वंसकारी सिद्ध होती है। आत्मविकास के सर्वोच्च शिखर तक पहुँचने की आकांक्षा रखने वाले उद्यमी साधक को ऐसा आन्तरिक सामञ्जस्य स्थापित करना चाहिए कि उसकी वाणी आत्मा की सुरभि का अनुकरण करे। स्वर की कोमलता? वचनों की स्पष्टता? निश्चय्ा की सत्यता? प्रच्छन्न अर्थ से रहित विचारों को श्रोता के मन में स्पष्ट करने की क्षमता? निष्कपटता? भक्ति और प्रेम इन सब से परिपूर्ण संभाषण वक्ता के व्यक्तित्व के आत्मचरित्र का एक विशिष्ट और श्रेष्ठ गुण ही बन जाता है। इस प्रकार के मधुर संभाषण के गुण का स्वयं में विकास करने से अपने व्यक्तित्व के अन्य आयामों का भी स्वत विकास हो जाता है? जो अन्तकरण को अनुशासित करने के लिए आवश्यक होता है।भूतमात्र के प्रति दया दुख और कष्ट से पीड़ित प्राणियों के प्रति कृपा का भाव दया कहलाता है। इसके अतिरिक्त? एक साधक को समाज में रहते हुए यह अपेक्षा नहीं करनी चाहिए कि समाज के सभी लोग उन्हीं आदर्शों या जीवन मूल्यों का अनुकरण करें? जिनके प्रति स्वयं उसकी श्रद्धा है। लोगों की दृष्टियों में भेद होता है और इसलिए उसे अपने आसपास के लोगों में अपूर्णता और दोष दिखाई दे सकते हैं। परन्तु? उनको इन समस्त दोषों के अन्तरंग में स्थित आत्मा के असीम सौन्दर्य को देखते रहना चाहिए। आत्मदर्शन की यह क्षमता ही सभी साधुओं और सन्तों के मन में स्थित प्राणिमात्र के प्रति दया का रहस्य है। सब के प्रति मन में प्रेम होने पर ही उनके प्रति असीम सहानुभूति और स्नेह का भाव हृदय में उठ सकता है। आत्मा की इस सुन्दरता को यदि अत्यन्त दुखी और दुश्चरित्र व्यक्ति में भी हम नहीं देख सके? तो उनके प्रति हमारे हृदय में स्नेह और दया उत्पन्न नहीं हो सकती।अलोलुपता प्रलोभित और आकर्षित करने वाले विषयों की उपस्थिति में भी मन में विकार उत्पन्न नहीं होना अलोलुपता है।मार्दव (मृदुता) और लज्जा यहाँ लज्जा का अर्थ है? निषिद्ध और निन्द्य प्रकार के कर्म करने में लज्जा का अनुभव करना। इसे दूसरे शब्दों में इस प्रकार कहा जा सकता है कि निन्द्य कर्मों का त्याग करना तथा शुभ कर्मों में गर्व का न होना अर्थात् नम्रता? विनयशीलता का होना लज्जा शब्द का अभिप्रेत अर्थ है। वस्तुत जो व्यक्ति उपर्युक्त गुणों से सम्पन्न होता है? उसमें स्वभाव की मृदुता और विनयशीलता स्वाभाविक रूप में आ जाती है? क्योंकि ये दोनों गुण मनुष्य की श्रेष्ठ संस्कृति के द्योतक हैं।अचापलम् मनुष्य के मन की चंचलता और स्वभाव की अस्थिरता उसकी शारीरिक चेष्टाओं में प्रकट होती है। सतत चंचलता? अकस्मात् कर्म का प्रारम्भ करना? अश्लील प्रकार की शारीरिक चेष्टाएं? व्यसनानन्द के अतिरेक से अंग प्रक्षेपण इत्यादि लक्षण केवल एक असंस्कृत व्यक्ति में देखे जाते हैं? जिसने न कभी स्वभाव की स्थिरता को और न कभी व्यक्तित्व को आदर्शपूर्ण बनाने का प्रयत्न किया हो। ये लक्षण एक शिशु में देखे जाते हैं? और उस दशा में वे उसके सौन्दर्यवर्धक ही माने जाते हैं। परन्तु जैसेजैसे व्यक्ति का विकास होता जाता है? उसका आत्मसंयम ही उसका सौन्दर्य समझा जाता है? जो उसकी शारीरिक चेष्टाओं के द्वारा स्पष्ट होता है।श्री शंकराचार्य जी इसका अर्थ बताते हैं? प्रयोजन के अभाव में हाथ? पैर? वाणी आदि इन्द्रियों का व्यापार न होना अचापलम् कहलाता है। यह इस शब्द का व्यापक अर्थ है और इसका आशय यह भी है कि लक्ष्य प्राप्ति के लिए उपयोगी कार्य में तत्परता और समस्त शारीरिक शक्तियों की मितव्ययिता होना चाहिए। अनावश्यक चेष्टाएं करना दुर्बल व्यक्तित्व का लक्षण है। ऐसे व्यक्ति कल्पनाओं में ही खोये रहते हैं और मानसिक तथा बौद्धिक स्तर पर अत्यन्त दुर्बल होते हैं। अत अचापलम् नामक गुण के सम्पादन से हम अपने व्यक्तित्व की अनेक प्रकार की सामान्य दुर्बलताओं का उपचार कर सकते हैं।और",

            "Devnagri": "अहिंसा प्राणियों को पीड़ा न पहुँचाना अहिंसा है। स्वार्थ या द्वेषवशात् किसी को पीड़ित करना हिंसा है। अहिंसा का पालन शरीर? वाणी और मन इन तीनों स्तर पर होना चाहिए। कभीकभी बाह्यदृष्टि से कोई व्यक्ति शरीर को पीड़ा पहुँचाते हुए दिखाई देता है? जैसे एक शल्य चिकित्सक रोगी की चिकित्सा करते हुऐ? उसे पीड़ा देता है किन्तु वह हिंसा नहीं मानी जाती। वैसे भी शारीरिक स्तर पर सम्पूर्ण अहिंसा संभव नहीं हो सकती है? किन्तु मन में कदापि हिंसा का भाव नहीं होना चाहिए। चिकित्सक के मन में इस हिंसा का भाव न होने से उसके द्वारा की गई शल्य चिकित्सा को हिंसा नहीं कहा जाता।सत्यम् सत्य का कुछ भाव आर्जव शब्द की व्याख्या में प्रकट किया जा चुका है। प्रमाणों से सिद्ध अर्थ को उसी रूप में प्रकट करना सत्य कहलाता है।अक्रोध यहाँ इस शब्द का क्रोध का सर्वथा अभाव अर्थ अभिप्रेत नहीं है। साधना की स्थिति में कभीकभी किसी घटना अथवा किसी के दुर्व्यवहार से मन में क्रोध आ जाता है? परन्तु तत्काल ही उसे पहचान कर उसका उपशमन करने की क्षमता को यहाँ अक्रोध कहा गया है। साधक को यह प्रयत्न करना चाहिए कि वह भी अपने क्रोध को क्रियारूप में व्यक्त न होने दे। इसी प्रकार की अन्य वृत्तियों का उपशमन करने की सार्मथ्य साधक को सम्पादित करनी चाहिए।त्याग यहाँ अहंकार और स्वार्थ का त्याग करने के लिए कहा गया है। पूर्व श्लोक के समान यहाँ उल्लिखित गुणों में भी परस्पर संबंध है। त्याग के अभाव में अक्रोध भी सिद्ध नहीं हो सकता? क्योंकि जब कोई हमारे अहंकार या स्वार्थ को चोट या हानि पहुंचाता है? तभी हमें क्रोध आता है।शान्ति उपर्युक्त गुणों से सम्पन्न व्यक्ति के मन में विक्षेपों का कोई कारण नहीं रह जाता? इसलिए उसके मन की शान्ति बनी रहती है। बाह्य जगत् की अथवा उसके व्यक्तिगत जीवन की परिस्थितियां कितनी ही दुखदायक और आक्रामक क्यों न हों? उस व्यक्ति का मनसन्तुलन कभी विचलित नहीं होता है।अपैशुनम् किसी व्यक्ति के दोषों को अन्य लोगों के समक्ष प्रकट करने को पैशुन कहते हैं। पैशुन का अभाव ही अपैशुन है। वाणी की मधुरता या कर्कशता वक्ता के व्यक्तित्व पर निर्भर करती है। एक अयुक्त (अर्थात् अशुद्ध अन्तकरण वाले) पुरुष को अन्य लोगों की द्वेषयुक्त निन्दा करने में एक प्रकार का आसुरी आनन्द प्राप्त होता है। प्राय यह कोमल और मांसल जिह्वा ही किसी विनाशकारी अस्त्र से भी अधिक विध्वंसकारी सिद्ध होती है। आत्मविकास के सर्वोच्च शिखर तक पहुँचने की आकांक्षा रखने वाले उद्यमी साधक को ऐसा आन्तरिक सामञ्जस्य स्थापित करना चाहिए कि उसकी वाणी आत्मा की सुरभि का अनुकरण करे। स्वर की कोमलता? वचनों की स्पष्टता? निश्चय्ा की सत्यता? प्रच्छन्न अर्थ से रहित विचारों को श्रोता के मन में स्पष्ट करने की क्षमता? निष्कपटता? भक्ति और प्रेम इन सब से परिपूर्ण संभाषण वक्ता के व्यक्तित्व के आत्मचरित्र का एक विशिष्ट और श्रेष्ठ गुण ही बन जाता है। इस प्रकार के मधुर संभाषण के गुण का स्वयं में विकास करने से अपने व्यक्तित्व के अन्य आयामों का भी स्वत विकास हो जाता है? जो अन्तकरण को अनुशासित करने के लिए आवश्यक होता है।भूतमात्र के प्रति दया दुख और कष्ट से पीड़ित प्राणियों के प्रति कृपा का भाव दया कहलाता है। इसके अतिरिक्त? एक साधक को समाज में रहते हुए यह अपेक्षा नहीं करनी चाहिए कि समाज के सभी लोग उन्हीं आदर्शों या जीवन मूल्यों का अनुकरण करें? जिनके प्रति स्वयं उसकी श्रद्धा है। लोगों की दृष्टियों में भेद होता है और इसलिए उसे अपने आसपास के लोगों में अपूर्णता और दोष दिखाई दे सकते हैं। परन्तु? उनको इन समस्त दोषों के अन्तरंग में स्थित आत्मा के असीम सौन्दर्य को देखते रहना चाहिए। आत्मदर्शन की यह क्षमता ही सभी साधुओं और सन्तों के मन में स्थित प्राणिमात्र के प्रति दया का रहस्य है। सब के प्रति मन में प्रेम होने पर ही उनके प्रति असीम सहानुभूति और स्नेह का भाव हृदय में उठ सकता है। आत्मा की इस सुन्दरता को यदि अत्यन्त दुखी और दुश्चरित्र व्यक्ति में भी हम नहीं देख सके? तो उनके प्रति हमारे हृदय में स्नेह और दया उत्पन्न नहीं हो सकती।अलोलुपता प्रलोभित और आकर्षित करने वाले विषयों की उपस्थिति में भी मन में विकार उत्पन्न नहीं होना अलोलुपता है।मार्दव (मृदुता) और लज्जा यहाँ लज्जा का अर्थ है? निषिद्ध और निन्द्य प्रकार के कर्म करने में लज्जा का अनुभव करना। इसे दूसरे शब्दों में इस प्रकार कहा जा सकता है कि निन्द्य कर्मों का त्याग करना तथा शुभ कर्मों में गर्व का न होना अर्थात् नम्रता? विनयशीलता का होना लज्जा शब्द का अभिप्रेत अर्थ है। वस्तुत जो व्यक्ति उपर्युक्त गुणों से सम्पन्न होता है? उसमें स्वभाव की मृदुता और विनयशीलता स्वाभाविक रूप में आ जाती है? क्योंकि ये दोनों गुण मनुष्य की श्रेष्ठ संस्कृति के द्योतक हैं।अचापलम् मनुष्य के मन की चंचलता और स्वभाव की अस्थिरता उसकी शारीरिक चेष्टाओं में प्रकट होती है। सतत चंचलता? अकस्मात् कर्म का प्रारम्भ करना? अश्लील प्रकार की शारीरिक चेष्टाएं? व्यसनानन्द के अतिरेक से अंग प्रक्षेपण इत्यादि लक्षण केवल एक असंस्कृत व्यक्ति में देखे जाते हैं? जिसने न कभी स्वभाव की स्थिरता को और न कभी व्यक्तित्व को आदर्शपूर्ण बनाने का प्रयत्न किया हो। ये लक्षण एक शिशु में देखे जाते हैं? और उस दशा में वे उसके सौन्दर्यवर्धक ही माने जाते हैं। परन्तु जैसेजैसे व्यक्ति का विकास होता जाता है? उसका आत्मसंयम ही उसका सौन्दर्य समझा जाता है? जो उसकी शारीरिक चेष्टाओं के द्वारा स्पष्ट होता है।श्री शंकराचार्य जी इसका अर्थ बताते हैं? प्रयोजन के अभाव में हाथ? पैर? वाणी आदि इन्द्रियों का व्यापार न होना अचापलम् कहलाता है। यह इस शब्द का व्यापक अर्थ है और इसका आशय यह भी है कि लक्ष्य प्राप्ति के लिए उपयोगी कार्य में तत्परता और समस्त शारीरिक शक्तियों की मितव्ययिता होना चाहिए। अनावश्यक चेष्टाएं करना दुर्बल व्यक्तित्व का लक्षण है। ऐसे व्यक्ति कल्पनाओं में ही खोये रहते हैं और मानसिक तथा बौद्धिक स्तर पर अत्यन्त दुर्बल होते हैं। अत अचापलम् नामक गुण के सम्पादन से हम अपने व्यक्तित्व की अनेक प्रकार की सामान्य दुर्बलताओं का उपचार कर सकते हैं।और",

The destiny associated with the divinities is divine. The divinities are those who are devoted to carry out the ?ndments of the Lord. It is their destiny. It is obedience to the ?ndments of the Lord.

The aspirant who is bent on attaining salvation marches boldly on the spiritual path. Nothing can tempt him or slacken his progress. This unbroken progress towards the realisation of the Self or the Absolute is lustre. It overcomes the downward pull of Tamas.Kshama Forgiveness. He who is endowed with this virtue does not exhibit anger even when he is insulted, ruked or beaten, although he is strong enough to take vengeance. He is unaffected by the insult or injury.Dhriti The sage absorbs within himself all calamities. He is steadfast even when he is in very adverse and trying conditions this is a particular Sattvic Vritti or state of mind which removes depression or exhaustion of the body and senses when they sink down. An aspirant who is endowed with this divine attribute never gets disheartened, even when he is under severe trials and difficulties or tribulations. Dhriti is a divine pickmeup (tonic) when the body and the senses are in a state of low spirits or dejection.Saucham Purity. This is of two kinds, viz., external and internal. External purity is achieved by means of earth and water. The mind and heart (intellect) are freed from Maya (deception, lust, anger, greed, pride, jealousy, hypocrisy, likes and dislikes) by the practice of celibacy, forgiveness, friendliness, charity, humility, nobilit, love, complacency, compassion, etc. -- this is internal purity. This is more important than external purity.Adroha Absence of hatred, absence of desire to injure others.Atimanita is great pride. A proud man thinks that he is superior to others and that he is worthy of being honoured by others. Naatimanita is the opposite of this ality.Tejas, Kshama and Dhriti are the special alities or Dharmas of the Kshatriyas (warrior class). These are the Sattvic alities of Kshatriyas. Saucham and Adroha are the special Dharmas of the Vaisyas. They are the Sattvic alities of the Vaisyas (merchant class). Absence of pride is the special Dharma of the Sudras (servant class). It is a Sattvic ality that belongs to the Sudras.The divine wealth or Daivi Sampat consists of twentysix attributes. This is a rare gift from the Lord. This is an inexhaustible wealth which cannot be taken away by dacoits. This helps the aspirant attain the imperishable and immacultate Brahmic seat.

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या--'तेजः'--महापुरुषोंका सङ्ग मिलनेपर उनके प्रभावसे प्रभावित होकर साधारण पुरुष भी दुर्गुण-दुराचारोंका त्याग करके सद्गुण-सदाचारोंमें लग जाते हैं। महापुरुषोंकी उस शक्तिको ही यहाँ 'तेज' कहा है। ऐसे तो क्रोधी आदमीको देखकर भी लोगोंको उसके स्वभावके विरुद्ध काम करनेमें भय लगता है; परन्तु यह क्रोधरूप दोषका तेज है। साधकमें दैवी सम्पत्तिके गुण प्रकट होनेसे उसको देखकर दूसरे लोगोंके भीतर स्वाभाविक ही सौम्यभाव आते हैं अर्थात् उस साधकके सामने दूसरे लोग दुराचार करनेमें लज्जित होते हैं, हिचकते हैं और अनायास ही सद्भावपूर्वक सदाचार करने लग जाते हैं। यही उन दैवी-सम्पत्तिवालोंका तेज (प्रभाव) है। 'क्षमा'--बिना कारण अपराध करनेवालेको दण्ड देनेकी सामर्थ्य रहते हुए भी उसके अपराधको सह लेना और उसको माफ कर देना 'क्षमा' (टिप्पणी प0 798) है। यह क्षमा मोह-ममता, भय और स्वार्थको लेकर भी की जाती है; जैसे--पुत्रके अपराध कर देनेपर पिता उसे 'क्षमा' कर देता है, तो यह क्षमा मोह-ममताको लेकर होनेसे शुद्ध नही है। इसी प्रकार किसी बलवान् एवं क्रूर व्यक्तिके द्वारा हमारा अपराध किये जानेपर हम भयवश उसके सामने कुछ नहीं बोलते, तो यह क्षमा भयको लेकर है। हमारी धन-सम्पत्तिकी जाँच-पड़ताल करनेके लिये इन्सपेक्टर आता है, तो वह हमें धमकाता है, अनुचित भी बोलता है और उसका ठहरना हमें बुरा भी लगता है तो भी स्वार्थ-हानिके भयसे हम उसके सामने कुछ नहीं बोलते, तो यह क्षमा स्वार्थको लेकर है। पर ऐसी क्षमा वास्तविक क्षमा नहीं है। वास्तविक क्षमा तो वही है, जिसमें 'हमारा अनिष्ट करनेवालेको यहाँ और परलोकमें भी किसी प्रकारका दण्ड न मिले' -- ऐसा भाव रहता है।क्षमा माँगना भी दो रीतिसे होता है --(1) हमने किसीका अपकार किया, तो उसका दण्ड हमें न मिले -- इस भयसे भी क्षमा माँगी जाती है; परन्तु इस क्षमामें स्वार्थका भाव रहनेसे यह ऊँचे दर्जेकी क्षमा नहीं है। (2) हमसे किसीका अपराध हुआ, तो अब यहाँसे आगे उम्रभर ऐसा अपराध फिर कभी नहीं करूँगा -- इस भावसे जो क्षमा माँगी जाती है, वह अपने सुधारकी दृष्टिको लेकर होती है और ऐसी क्षमा माँगनेसे ही मनुष्यकी उन्नति होती है। मनुष्य क्षमाको अपनेमें लाना चाहे तो कौन-सा उपाय करे? यदि मनुष्य अपने लिये किसीसे किसी प्रकारके सुखकी आशा न रखे और अपना अपकार करनेवालेका बुरा न चाहे? तो उसमें क्षमाभाव प्रकट हो जाता है। 'धृतिः'--किसी भी अनुकूल या प्रतिकूल परिस्थितिमें विचलित न होकर अपनी स्थितिमें कायम रहनेकी शक्तिका नाम 'धृति' (धैर्य) है (गीता 18। 33)। वृत्तियाँ सात्त्विक होती हैं तो धैर्य ठीक रहता है और वृत्तियाँ राजसी-तामसी होती हैं तो धैर्य वैसा नहीं रहता। जैसे बद्रीनारायणके रास्तेपर चलनेवालेके लिये कभी गरमी, चढ़ाई आदि प्रतिकूलताएँ आती हैं और कभी ठण्डक, उतराई आदि अनुकूलताएँ आती हैं, पर चलनेवालेको उन प्रतिकूलताओं और अनूकूलताओंको देखकर ठहरना नहीं है, प्रत्युत 'हमें तो बद्रीनारायण पहुँचना है' -- इस उद्देश्यसे धैर्य और तत्परतापूर्वक चलते रहना है। ऐसे ही साधकको अच्छी-मन्दी वृत्तियों और अनुकूल-प्रतिकूल परिस्थितियोंकी ओर देखना ही नहीं चाहिये। इनमें उसे धीरज धारण करना चाहिये; क्योंकि जो अपना उद्देश्य सिद्ध करना चाहता है, वह मार्गमें आनेवाले सुख और दुःखको नहीं देखता-- मनस्वी कार्यार्थी न गणयति दुःखं न च सुखम्।। (भर्तृहरिनीतिशतक) 'शौचम्'--बाह्यशुद्धि एवं अन्तःशुद्धिका नाम 'शौच' है (टिप्पणी प0 799.1)। परमात्मप्राप्तिका उद्देश्य रखनेवाला साधक बाह्यशुद्धिका भी खयाल रखता है; क्योंकि बाह्यशुद्धि रखनेसे अन्तःकरणकी शुद्धि स्वतः होती है और अन्तःकरण शुद्ध होनेपर बाह्य-अशुद्धि उसको सुहाती नहीं। इस विषयपर पतञ्जलि महाराजने कहा है -- शौचात् स्वाङ्गजुगुप्सा परैरसंसर्गः।(योगदर्शन 2। 40)'शौचसे साधककी अपने शरीरमें घृणा अर्थात् अपवित्र-बुद्धि और दूसरोंसे संसर्ग न करनेकी इच्छा होती है।' तात्पर्य यह है कि अपने शरीरको शुद्ध रखनेसे शरीरकी अपवित्रताका ज्ञान होता है। शरीरकी अपवित्रताका ज्ञान होनेसे सम्पूर्ण शरीर इसी तरहके हैं -- इसका बोध होता है। इस बोधसे दूसरे शरीरोंके प्रति जो आकर्षण होता है, उसका अभाव हो जाता है अर्थात् दूसरे शरीरोंसे सुख लेनेकी इच्छा मिट जाती है। बाह्यशुद्धि चार प्रकारसे होती है -- (1) शारीरिक (2) वाचिक, (3) कौटुम्बिक और (4) आर्थिक। (1) 'शारीरिक शुद्धि'--प्रमाद, आलस्य, आरामतलबी, स्वाद-शौकीनी आदिसे शरीर अशुद्ध हो जाता है और इनके विपरीत कार्य-तत्परता, पुरुषार्थ, उद्योग, सादगी आदि रखते हुए आवश्यक कार्य करनेपर शरीर शुद्ध हो जाता है। ऐसे ही जल, मृत्तिका आदिसे भी शारीरिक शुद्धि होती है। (2) 'वाचिक शुद्धि'--झूठ बोलने, कड़ुआ बोलने, वृक्षा बकवाद करने, निन्दा करने, चुगली करने आदिसे वाणी अशुद्ध हो जाती है। इन दोषोंसे रहित होकर सत्य, प्रिय एवं हितकारक आवश्यक वचन बोलना (जिससे दूसरोंकी पारमार्थिक उन्नति होती हो और देश, ग्राम, मोहल्ले, परिवार, कुटुम्ब आदिका हित होता हो) और अनावश्यक बात न करना -- यह वाणीकी शुद्धि है। (3) 'कौटुम्बिक शुद्धि'--अपने बाल-बच्चोंको अच्छी शिक्षा देना; जिससे उनका हित हो, वही आचरण करना; कुटुम्बियोंका हमपर जो न्याययुक्त अधिकार है, उसको अपनी शक्तिके अनुसार पूरा करना; कुटुम्बियोंमें किसीका पक्षपात न करके सबका समानरूपसे हित करना -- यह कौटुम्बिक शुद्धि है। (4) 'आर्थिक शुद्धि'--न्याययुक्त, सत्यतापूर्वक, दूसरोंके हितका बर्ताव करते हुए जिस धनका उपार्जन किया गया है, उसको यथाशक्ति, अरक्षित, अभावग्रस्त, दरिद्री, रोगी, अकालपीड़ित, भूखे आदि आवश्यकतावालोंको देनेसे एवं गौ, स्त्री, ब्राह्मणोंकी रक्षामें लगानेसे द्रव्यकी शुद्धि होती है।त्यागी-वैरागी-तपस्वी सन्त-महापुरुषोंकी सेवामें लगानेसे एवं सद्ग्रन्थोंको सरल भाषामें छपवाकर कम मूल्यमें देनेसे तथा उनका लोगोंमें प्रचार करनेसे धनकी महान् शुद्धि हो जाती है।परमात्मप्राप्तिका ही उद्देश्य हो जानेपर अपनी (स्वयंकी) शुद्धि हो जाती है। स्वयंकी शुद्धि होनेपर शरीर, वाणी, कुटुम्ब, धन आदि सभी शुद्ध एवं पवित्र होने लगते हैं। शरीर आदिके शुद्ध हो जानेसे वहाँका स्थान? वायुमण्डल आदि भी शुद्ध हो जाते हैं। बाह्यशुद्धि और पवित्रताका खयाल रखनेसे शरीरकी वास्तविकता अनुभवमें आ जाती है? जिससे शरीरसे अंहताममता छोड़नेमें सहायता मिलती है। इस प्रकार यह साधन भी परमात्मप्राप्तिमें निमित्त बनता है। 'अद्रोहः'--बिना कारण अनिष्ट करनेवालेके प्रति भी अन्तःकरणमें बदला लेनेकी भावनाका न होना 'अद्रोह' (टिप्पणी प0 799.2) है। साधारण व्यक्तिका कोई अनिष्ट करता है, तो उसके मनमें अनिष्ट करनेवालेके प्रति द्वेषकी एक गाँठ बँध जाती है कि मौका पड़नेपर मैं इसका बदला ले ही लूँगा; किन्तु जिसका उद्देश्य परमात्मप्राप्तिका है, उस साधकका कोई कितना ही अनिष्ट क्यों न करे, उसके मनमें अनिष्ट करनेवालेके प्रति बदला लेनेकी भावना ही पैदा नहीं होती। कारण कि कर्मयोगका साधक सबके हितके लिये कर्तव्य-कर्म करता है, ज्ञानयोगका साधक सबको अपना स्वरूप समझता है और भक्तियोगका साधक सबमें अपने इष्ट भगवान्को समझता है। अतः वह किसीके प्रति कैसे द्रोह कर सकता है।'निज प्रभुमय देखहिं जगत केहि सन करहिं बिरोध'।।(मानस 7। 112 ख) 'नातिमानिता'--एक 'मानिता' होती है और एक 'अतिमानिता' होती है। सामान्य व्यक्तियोंसे मान चाहना 'मानिता' है और जिनसे हमने शिक्षा प्राप्त की, जिनका आदर्श ग्रहण किया और ग्रहण करना चाहते हैं, उनसे भी अपना मान, आदर-सत्कार चाहना 'अतिमानिता' है। इन मानिता और अतिमानिताका न होना 'नातिमानिता' है।स्थूल दृष्टिसे मानिता के दो भेद होते हैं -- (1) 'सांसारिक मानिता'--धन, विद्या, गुण, बुद्धि, योग्यता, अधिकार, पद, वर्ण, आश्रम आदिको लेकर दूसरोंकी अपेक्षा अपनेमें एक श्रेष्ठताका भाव होता है कि 'मैं साधारण मनुष्योंकी तरह थोड़े ही हूँ, मेरा कितने लोग आदरसत्कार करते हैं! वे आदर करते हैं तो यह ठीक ही है; क्योंकि मैं आदर पानेयोग्य ही हूँ' -- इस प्रकार अपने प्रति जो मान्यता होती है, वह सांसारिक मानिता कहलाती है। (2) 'पारमार्थिक मानिता'--प्रारम्भिक साधनकालमें जब अपनेमें कुछ दैवी-सम्पत्ति प्रकट होने लगती है, तब साधकको दूसरोंकी अपेक्षा अपनेमें कुछ विशेषता दीखती है। साथ ही दूसरे लोग भी उसे परमात्माकी ओर चलनेवाला साधक मानकर उसका विशेष आदर करते हैं और साथ-ही-साथ 'ये साधन करनेवाले हैं, अच्छे सज्जन हैं' -- ऐसी प्रशंसा भी करते हैं। इससे साधकको अपनेमें विशेषता मालूम देती है, पर वास्तवमें यह विशेषता अपने साधनमें कमी होनेके कारण ही दीखती है। यह विशेषता दीखना पारमार्थिक मानिता है। जबतक अपनेमें व्यक्तित्व (एकदेशीयता, परिछिन्नता) रहता है, तभीतक अपनेमें दूसरोंकी अपेक्षा विशेषता दिखायी दिया करती है। परन्तु ज्यों-ज्यों व्यक्तित्व मिटता चला जाता है, त्यों-ही-त्यों साधकका दूसरोंकी अपेक्षा अपनेमें विशेषताका भाव मिटता चला जाता है। अन्तमें इन सभी मानिताओंका अभाव होकर साधकमें दैवी-सम्पत्तिका गुण 'नातिमानिता' प्रकट हो जाती है।दैवीसम्पत्तिके जितने सद्गुण-सदाचार हैं, उनको पूर्णतया जाग्रत् करनेका उद्देश्य तो साधकका होना ही चाहिये। हाँ, प्रकृति-(स्वभाव-) की भिन्नतासे किसीमें किसी गुणकी कमी, तो किसीमें किसी गुणकी कमी रह सकती है। परन्तु वह कमी साधकके मनमें खटकती रहती है और वह प्रभुका आश्रय लेकर अपने साधनको तत्परतासे करते रहता है; अतः भगवत्कृपासे वह कमी मिटती जाती है। कमी ज्यों-ज्यों मिटती जाती है, त्यों-त्यों उत्साह और उस कमीके उत्तरोत्तर मिटनेकी सम्भावना भी बढ़ती जाती है। इससे दुर्गुण-दुराचार सर्वथा नष्ट होकर सद्गुण-सदाचार अर्थात् दैवी-सम्पत्ति प्रकट हो जाती है। 'भवन्ति सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातस्य भारत'--भगवान् कहते हैं कि हे अर्जुन! ये सभी दैवी-सम्पत्तिको प्राप्त हुए मनुष्योंके लक्षण हैं। परमात्मप्राप्तिका उद्देश्य होनेपर ये दैवी-सम्पत्तिके लक्षण साधकमें स्वाभाविक ही आने लगते हैं। कुछ लक्षण पूर्वजन्मोंके संस्कारोंसे भी जाग्रत् होते हैं। परन्तु साधक इन गुणोंको अपने नहीं मानता और न उनको अपने पुरुषार्थसे उपार्जित ही मानता है, प्रत्युत गुणोंके आनेमें वह भगवान्की ही कृपा मानता है। कभी खयाल करनेपर साधकके मनमें ऐसा विचार होता है कि मेरेमें पहले तो ऐसी वृत्तियाँ नहीं थीं, ऐसे सद्गुण नहीं थे, फिर ये कहाँसे आ गये? तो ये सब भगवान्की कृपासे ही आये हैं -- ऐसा अनुभव होनेसे उस साधकको दैवी-सम्पत्तिका अभिमान नहीं आता। साधकको दैवी-सम्पत्तिके गुणोंको अपने नहीं मानना चाहिये; क्योंकि यह देव -- परमात्माकी सम्पत्ति है, व्यक्तिगत (अपनी) किसीकी नहीं है। यदि व्यक्तिगत होती, तो यह अपनेमें ही रहती, किसी अन्य व्यक्तिकी नहीं रहती। इसको व्यक्तिगत माननेसे ही अभिमान आता है। अभिमान आसुरी-सम्पत्तिका मुख्य लक्षण है। अभिमानकी छायामें ही आसुरी-सम्पत्तिका मुख्य लक्षण है। अभिमानकी छायामें ही आसुरी-सम्पत्तिके सभी अवगुण रहते हैं। यदि दैवी-सम्पत्तिसे आसुरी-सम्पत्ति (अभिमान) पैदा हो जाय, तो फिर आसुरीसम्पत्ति कभी मिटेगी ही नहीं। परन्तु दैवी-सम्पत्तिसे आसुरी-सम्पत्ति कभी पैदा नहीं होती, प्रत्युत दैवी-सम्पत्तिके गुणोंके साथसाथ आसुरीसम्पत्तिके जो अवगुण रहते हैं, उनसे ही गुणोंका अभिमान पैदा होता है अर्थात् साधनके साथ कुछ-कुछ असाधन रहनेसे ही अभिमान आदि दोष पैदा होते हैं। जैसे, किसीको सत्य बोलनेका अभिमान होता है, तो उसके मूलमें वह सत्यके साथ-साथ असत्य भी बोलता है, जिसके कारण सत्यका अभिमान आता है। तात्पर्य यह है कि दैवी-सम्पत्तिके गुणोंको अपना माननेसे एवं गुणोंके साथ अवगुण रहनेसे ही अभिमान आता है। सर्वथा गुण आनेपर गुणोंका अभिमान हो ही नहीं सकता। यहाँ दैवी-सम्पत्ति कहनेका तात्पर्य है कि यह भगवान्की सम्पत्ति है। अतः भगवान्का सम्बन्ध होनेसे, उनका आश्रय लेनेसे शरणागत भक्तमें यह स्वाभाविक ही आती है। जैसे शबरीके प्रसङ्गमें रामजीने कहा है --, नवधा भगति कहउँ तोहिं पाहीं। सावधान सुनु धरु मन माहीं।। नव महुँ एकउ जिन्ह कें होई। नारि पुरुष सचराचर कोई।। सोइ अतिसय प्रिय भामिनि मोरें। सकल प्रकार भगति दृढ़ तोरें।। (मानस 3। 35 -- 36) मनुष्य-देवता, भूत-पिशाच, पशु-पक्षी, नारकीय जीव, कीट-पतङ्ग, लता-वृक्ष आदि जितने भी स्थावर-जङ्गम प्राणी हैं, उन सबमें अपनी-अपनी योनिके अनुसार मिले हुए शरीरोंके रुग्ण एवं जीर्ण हो जानेपर भी 'मैं जीता रहूँ, मेरे प्राण बने रहें' -- यह इच्छा बनी रहती है (टिप्पणी प0 801)। इस इच्छाका होना ही आसुरी-सम्पत्ति है।त्यागी-वैरागी साधकमें भी प्राणोंके बने रहनेकी इच्छा रहती है; परन्तु उसमें प्राणपोषण-बुद्धि, इन्द्रिय-लोलुपता नहीं रहती; क्योंकि उसका उद्देश्य परमात्मा होता है, न कि शरीर और संसार।जब साधक भक्तका भगवान्में प्रेम हो जाता है, तब उसको भगवान् प्राणोंसे भी प्यारे लगते हैं। प्राणोंका मोह न रहनेसे उसके प्राणोंका आधार केवल भगवान् हो जाते हैं। इसलिये वह भगवान्को प्राणनाथ! प्राणेश्वर! प्राणप्रिय!' आदि सम्बोधनोंसे पुकारता है। भगवान्का वियोग न सहनेसे उसके प्राण भी छूट सकते हैं। कारण कि मनुष्य जिस वस्तुको प्राणोंसे भी बढ़कर मान लेता है, उसके लिये यदि प्राणोंका त्याग करना पड़े तो वह सहर्ष प्राणोंका त्याग कर देता है; जैसे -- पतिव्रता स्त्री पतिको प्राणोंसे भी बढ़कर (प्राणनाथ) मानती है, तो उसका प्राण, शरीर, वस्तु, व्यक्ति आदिमें मोह नहीं रहता। इसीलिये पतिके मरनेपर वह उसके वियोगमें प्रसन्नतापूर्वक सती हो जाती है। तात्पर्य यह हुआ कि जब केवल भगवान्में अनन्य प्रेम हो जाता है, तो फिर प्राणोंका मोह नहीं रहता। प्राणोंका मोह न रहनेसे आसुरी-सम्पत्ति सर्वथा मिट जाती है और दैवी-सम्पत्ति स्वतः प्रकट हो जाती है। इसी बातका संकेत गोस्वामी तुलसीदाजसी महाराजने इस प्रकार किया है -- प्रेम भगति जल बिनु रघुराई। अभिअंतर मल कबहुँ न जाई।।(मानस 7। 49। 3) सम्बन्ध--अबतक एक परमात्माका ही उद्देश्य रखनेवालोंकी दैवी-सम्पत्ति बतायी; परन्तु सांसारिक भोग भोगना और संग्रह करना ही जिनका उद्देश्य है, ऐसे प्राणपोषणपरायण लोगोंकी कौन-सी सम्पत्ति होती है -- इसे अब आगेके श्लोकमें बताते हैं।",

            "Devnagri": "व्याख्या--'तेजः'--महापुरुषोंका सङ्ग मिलनेपर उनके प्रभावसे प्रभावित होकर साधारण पुरुष भी दुर्गुण-दुराचारोंका त्याग करके सद्गुण-सदाचारोंमें लग जाते हैं। महापुरुषोंकी उस शक्तिको ही यहाँ 'तेज' कहा है। ऐसे तो क्रोधी आदमीको देखकर भी लोगोंको उसके स्वभावके विरुद्ध काम करनेमें भय लगता है; परन्तु यह क्रोधरूप दोषका तेज है। साधकमें दैवी सम्पत्तिके गुण प्रकट होनेसे उसको देखकर दूसरे लोगोंके भीतर स्वाभाविक ही सौम्यभाव आते हैं अर्थात् उस साधकके सामने दूसरे लोग दुराचार करनेमें लज्जित होते हैं, हिचकते हैं और अनायास ही सद्भावपूर्वक सदाचार करने लग जाते हैं। यही उन दैवी-सम्पत्तिवालोंका तेज (प्रभाव) है। 'क्षमा'--बिना कारण अपराध करनेवालेको दण्ड देनेकी सामर्थ्य रहते हुए भी उसके अपराधको सह लेना और उसको माफ कर देना 'क्षमा' (टिप्पणी प0 798) है। यह क्षमा मोह-ममता, भय और स्वार्थको लेकर भी की जाती है; जैसे--पुत्रके अपराध कर देनेपर पिता उसे 'क्षमा' कर देता है, तो यह क्षमा मोह-ममताको लेकर होनेसे शुद्ध नही है। इसी प्रकार किसी बलवान् एवं क्रूर व्यक्तिके द्वारा हमारा अपराध किये जानेपर हम भयवश उसके सामने कुछ नहीं बोलते, तो यह क्षमा भयको लेकर है। हमारी धन-सम्पत्तिकी जाँच-पड़ताल करनेके लिये इन्सपेक्टर आता है, तो वह हमें धमकाता है, अनुचित भी बोलता है और उसका ठहरना हमें बुरा भी लगता है तो भी स्वार्थ-हानिके भयसे हम उसके सामने कुछ नहीं बोलते, तो यह क्षमा स्वार्थको लेकर है। पर ऐसी क्षमा वास्तविक क्षमा नहीं है। वास्तविक क्षमा तो वही है, जिसमें 'हमारा अनिष्ट करनेवालेको यहाँ और परलोकमें भी किसी प्रकारका दण्ड न मिले' -- ऐसा भाव रहता है।क्षमा माँगना भी दो रीतिसे होता है --(1) हमने किसीका अपकार किया, तो उसका दण्ड हमें न मिले -- इस भयसे भी क्षमा माँगी जाती है; परन्तु इस क्षमामें स्वार्थका भाव रहनेसे यह ऊँचे दर्जेकी क्षमा नहीं है। (2) हमसे किसीका अपराध हुआ, तो अब यहाँसे आगे उम्रभर ऐसा अपराध फिर कभी नहीं करूँगा -- इस भावसे जो क्षमा माँगी जाती है, वह अपने सुधारकी दृष्टिको लेकर होती है और ऐसी क्षमा माँगनेसे ही मनुष्यकी उन्नति होती है। मनुष्य क्षमाको अपनेमें लाना चाहे तो कौन-सा उपाय करे? यदि मनुष्य अपने लिये किसीसे किसी प्रकारके सुखकी आशा न रखे और अपना अपकार करनेवालेका बुरा न चाहे? तो उसमें क्षमाभाव प्रकट हो जाता है। 'धृतिः'--किसी भी अनुकूल या प्रतिकूल परिस्थितिमें विचलित न होकर अपनी स्थितिमें कायम रहनेकी शक्तिका नाम 'धृति' (धैर्य) है (गीता 18। 33)। वृत्तियाँ सात्त्विक होती हैं तो धैर्य ठीक रहता है और वृत्तियाँ राजसी-तामसी होती हैं तो धैर्य वैसा नहीं रहता। जैसे बद्रीनारायणके रास्तेपर चलनेवालेके लिये कभी गरमी, चढ़ाई आदि प्रतिकूलताएँ आती हैं और कभी ठण्डक, उतराई आदि अनुकूलताएँ आती हैं, पर चलनेवालेको उन प्रतिकूलताओं और अनूकूलताओंको देखकर ठहरना नहीं है, प्रत्युत 'हमें तो बद्रीनारायण पहुँचना है' -- इस उद्देश्यसे धैर्य और तत्परतापूर्वक चलते रहना है। ऐसे ही साधकको अच्छी-मन्दी वृत्तियों और अनुकूल-प्रतिकूल परिस्थितियोंकी ओर देखना ही नहीं चाहिये। इनमें उसे धीरज धारण करना चाहिये; क्योंकि जो अपना उद्देश्य सिद्ध करना चाहता है, वह मार्गमें आनेवाले सुख और दुःखको नहीं देखता-- मनस्वी कार्यार्थी न गणयति दुःखं न च सुखम्।। (भर्तृहरिनीतिशतक) 'शौचम्'--बाह्यशुद्धि एवं अन्तःशुद्धिका नाम 'शौच' है (टिप्पणी प0 799.1)। परमात्मप्राप्तिका उद्देश्य रखनेवाला साधक बाह्यशुद्धिका भी खयाल रखता है; क्योंकि बाह्यशुद्धि रखनेसे अन्तःकरणकी शुद्धि स्वतः होती है और अन्तःकरण शुद्ध होनेपर बाह्य-अशुद्धि उसको सुहाती नहीं। इस विषयपर पतञ्जलि महाराजने कहा है -- शौचात् स्वाङ्गजुगुप्सा परैरसंसर्गः।(योगदर्शन 2। 40)'शौचसे साधककी अपने शरीरमें घृणा अर्थात् अपवित्र-बुद्धि और दूसरोंसे संसर्ग न करनेकी इच्छा होती है।' तात्पर्य यह है कि अपने शरीरको शुद्ध रखनेसे शरीरकी अपवित्रताका ज्ञान होता है। शरीरकी अपवित्रताका ज्ञान होनेसे सम्पूर्ण शरीर इसी तरहके हैं -- इसका बोध होता है। इस बोधसे दूसरे शरीरोंके प्रति जो आकर्षण होता है, उसका अभाव हो जाता है अर्थात् दूसरे शरीरोंसे सुख लेनेकी इच्छा मिट जाती है। बाह्यशुद्धि चार प्रकारसे होती है -- (1) शारीरिक (2) वाचिक, (3) कौटुम्बिक और (4) आर्थिक। (1) 'शारीरिक शुद्धि'--प्रमाद, आलस्य, आरामतलबी, स्वाद-शौकीनी आदिसे शरीर अशुद्ध हो जाता है और इनके विपरीत कार्य-तत्परता, पुरुषार्थ, उद्योग, सादगी आदि रखते हुए आवश्यक कार्य करनेपर शरीर शुद्ध हो जाता है। ऐसे ही जल, मृत्तिका आदिसे भी शारीरिक शुद्धि होती है। (2) 'वाचिक शुद्धि'--झूठ बोलने, कड़ुआ बोलने, वृक्षा बकवाद करने, निन्दा करने, चुगली करने आदिसे वाणी अशुद्ध हो जाती है। इन दोषोंसे रहित होकर सत्य, प्रिय एवं हितकारक आवश्यक वचन बोलना (जिससे दूसरोंकी पारमार्थिक उन्नति होती हो और देश, ग्राम, मोहल्ले, परिवार, कुटुम्ब आदिका हित होता हो) और अनावश्यक बात न करना -- यह वाणीकी शुद्धि है। (3) 'कौटुम्बिक शुद्धि'--अपने बाल-बच्चोंको अच्छी शिक्षा देना; जिससे उनका हित हो, वही आचरण करना; कुटुम्बियोंका हमपर जो न्याययुक्त अधिकार है, उसको अपनी शक्तिके अनुसार पूरा करना; कुटुम्बियोंमें किसीका पक्षपात न करके सबका समानरूपसे हित करना -- यह कौटुम्बिक शुद्धि है। (4) 'आर्थिक शुद्धि'--न्याययुक्त, सत्यतापूर्वक, दूसरोंके हितका बर्ताव करते हुए जिस धनका उपार्जन किया गया है, उसको यथाशक्ति, अरक्षित, अभावग्रस्त, दरिद्री, रोगी, अकालपीड़ित, भूखे आदि आवश्यकतावालोंको देनेसे एवं गौ, स्त्री, ब्राह्मणोंकी रक्षामें लगानेसे द्रव्यकी शुद्धि होती है।त्यागी-वैरागी-तपस्वी सन्त-महापुरुषोंकी सेवामें लगानेसे एवं सद्ग्रन्थोंको सरल भाषामें छपवाकर कम मूल्यमें देनेसे तथा उनका लोगोंमें प्रचार करनेसे धनकी महान् शुद्धि हो जाती है।परमात्मप्राप्तिका ही उद्देश्य हो जानेपर अपनी (स्वयंकी) शुद्धि हो जाती है। स्वयंकी शुद्धि होनेपर शरीर, वाणी, कुटुम्ब, धन आदि सभी शुद्ध एवं पवित्र होने लगते हैं। शरीर आदिके शुद्ध हो जानेसे वहाँका स्थान? वायुमण्डल आदि भी शुद्ध हो जाते हैं। बाह्यशुद्धि और पवित्रताका खयाल रखनेसे शरीरकी वास्तविकता अनुभवमें आ जाती है? जिससे शरीरसे अंहताममता छोड़नेमें सहायता मिलती है। इस प्रकार यह साधन भी परमात्मप्राप्तिमें निमित्त बनता है। 'अद्रोहः'--बिना कारण अनिष्ट करनेवालेके प्रति भी अन्तःकरणमें बदला लेनेकी भावनाका न होना 'अद्रोह' (टिप्पणी प0 799.2) है। साधारण व्यक्तिका कोई अनिष्ट करता है, तो उसके मनमें अनिष्ट करनेवालेके प्रति द्वेषकी एक गाँठ बँध जाती है कि मौका पड़नेपर मैं इसका बदला ले ही लूँगा; किन्तु जिसका उद्देश्य परमात्मप्राप्तिका है, उस साधकका कोई कितना ही अनिष्ट क्यों न करे, उसके मनमें अनिष्ट करनेवालेके प्रति बदला लेनेकी भावना ही पैदा नहीं होती। कारण कि कर्मयोगका साधक सबके हितके लिये कर्तव्य-कर्म करता है, ज्ञानयोगका साधक सबको अपना स्वरूप समझता है और भक्तियोगका साधक सबमें अपने इष्ट भगवान्को समझता है। अतः वह किसीके प्रति कैसे द्रोह कर सकता है।'निज प्रभुमय देखहिं जगत केहि सन करहिं बिरोध'।।(मानस 7। 112 ख) 'नातिमानिता'--एक 'मानिता' होती है और एक 'अतिमानिता' होती है। सामान्य व्यक्तियोंसे मान चाहना 'मानिता' है और जिनसे हमने शिक्षा प्राप्त की, जिनका आदर्श ग्रहण किया और ग्रहण करना चाहते हैं, उनसे भी अपना मान, आदर-सत्कार चाहना 'अतिमानिता' है। इन मानिता और अतिमानिताका न होना 'नातिमानिता' है।स्थूल दृष्टिसे मानिता के दो भेद होते हैं -- (1) 'सांसारिक मानिता'--धन, विद्या, गुण, बुद्धि, योग्यता, अधिकार, पद, वर्ण, आश्रम आदिको लेकर दूसरोंकी अपेक्षा अपनेमें एक श्रेष्ठताका भाव होता है कि 'मैं साधारण मनुष्योंकी तरह थोड़े ही हूँ, मेरा कितने लोग आदरसत्कार करते हैं! वे आदर करते हैं तो यह ठीक ही है; क्योंकि मैं आदर पानेयोग्य ही हूँ' -- इस प्रकार अपने प्रति जो मान्यता होती है, वह सांसारिक मानिता कहलाती है। (2) 'पारमार्थिक मानिता'--प्रारम्भिक साधनकालमें जब अपनेमें कुछ दैवी-सम्पत्ति प्रकट होने लगती है, तब साधकको दूसरोंकी अपेक्षा अपनेमें कुछ विशेषता दीखती है। साथ ही दूसरे लोग भी उसे परमात्माकी ओर चलनेवाला साधक मानकर उसका विशेष आदर करते हैं और साथ-ही-साथ 'ये साधन करनेवाले हैं, अच्छे सज्जन हैं' -- ऐसी प्रशंसा भी करते हैं। इससे साधकको अपनेमें विशेषता मालूम देती है, पर वास्तवमें यह विशेषता अपने साधनमें कमी होनेके कारण ही दीखती है। यह विशेषता दीखना पारमार्थिक मानिता है। जबतक अपनेमें व्यक्तित्व (एकदेशीयता, परिछिन्नता) रहता है, तभीतक अपनेमें दूसरोंकी अपेक्षा विशेषता दिखायी दिया करती है। परन्तु ज्यों-ज्यों व्यक्तित्व मिटता चला जाता है, त्यों-ही-त्यों साधकका दूसरोंकी अपेक्षा अपनेमें विशेषताका भाव मिटता चला जाता है। अन्तमें इन सभी मानिताओंका अभाव होकर साधकमें दैवी-सम्पत्तिका गुण 'नातिमानिता' प्रकट हो जाती है।दैवीसम्पत्तिके जितने सद्गुण-सदाचार हैं, उनको पूर्णतया जाग्रत् करनेका उद्देश्य तो साधकका होना ही चाहिये। हाँ, प्रकृति-(स्वभाव-) की भिन्नतासे किसीमें किसी गुणकी कमी, तो किसीमें किसी गुणकी कमी रह सकती है। परन्तु वह कमी साधकके मनमें खटकती रहती है और वह प्रभुका आश्रय लेकर अपने साधनको तत्परतासे करते रहता है; अतः भगवत्कृपासे वह कमी मिटती जाती है। कमी ज्यों-ज्यों मिटती जाती है, त्यों-त्यों उत्साह और उस कमीके उत्तरोत्तर मिटनेकी सम्भावना भी बढ़ती जाती है। इससे दुर्गुण-दुराचार सर्वथा नष्ट होकर सद्गुण-सदाचार अर्थात् दैवी-सम्पत्ति प्रकट हो जाती है। 'भवन्ति सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातस्य भारत'--भगवान् कहते हैं कि हे अर्जुन! ये सभी दैवी-सम्पत्तिको प्राप्त हुए मनुष्योंके लक्षण हैं। परमात्मप्राप्तिका उद्देश्य होनेपर ये दैवी-सम्पत्तिके लक्षण साधकमें स्वाभाविक ही आने लगते हैं। कुछ लक्षण पूर्वजन्मोंके संस्कारोंसे भी जाग्रत् होते हैं। परन्तु साधक इन गुणोंको अपने नहीं मानता और न उनको अपने पुरुषार्थसे उपार्जित ही मानता है, प्रत्युत गुणोंके आनेमें वह भगवान्की ही कृपा मानता है। कभी खयाल करनेपर साधकके मनमें ऐसा विचार होता है कि मेरेमें पहले तो ऐसी वृत्तियाँ नहीं थीं, ऐसे सद्गुण नहीं थे, फिर ये कहाँसे आ गये? तो ये सब भगवान्की कृपासे ही आये हैं -- ऐसा अनुभव होनेसे उस साधकको दैवी-सम्पत्तिका अभिमान नहीं आता। साधकको दैवी-सम्पत्तिके गुणोंको अपने नहीं मानना चाहिये; क्योंकि यह देव -- परमात्माकी सम्पत्ति है, व्यक्तिगत (अपनी) किसीकी नहीं है। यदि व्यक्तिगत होती, तो यह अपनेमें ही रहती, किसी अन्य व्यक्तिकी नहीं रहती। इसको व्यक्तिगत माननेसे ही अभिमान आता है। अभिमान आसुरी-सम्पत्तिका मुख्य लक्षण है। अभिमानकी छायामें ही आसुरी-सम्पत्तिका मुख्य लक्षण है। अभिमानकी छायामें ही आसुरी-सम्पत्तिके सभी अवगुण रहते हैं। यदि दैवी-सम्पत्तिसे आसुरी-सम्पत्ति (अभिमान) पैदा हो जाय, तो फिर आसुरीसम्पत्ति कभी मिटेगी ही नहीं। परन्तु दैवी-सम्पत्तिसे आसुरी-सम्पत्ति कभी पैदा नहीं होती, प्रत्युत दैवी-सम्पत्तिके गुणोंके साथसाथ आसुरीसम्पत्तिके जो अवगुण रहते हैं, उनसे ही गुणोंका अभिमान पैदा होता है अर्थात् साधनके साथ कुछ-कुछ असाधन रहनेसे ही अभिमान आदि दोष पैदा होते हैं। जैसे, किसीको सत्य बोलनेका अभिमान होता है, तो उसके मूलमें वह सत्यके साथ-साथ असत्य भी बोलता है, जिसके कारण सत्यका अभिमान आता है। तात्पर्य यह है कि दैवी-सम्पत्तिके गुणोंको अपना माननेसे एवं गुणोंके साथ अवगुण रहनेसे ही अभिमान आता है। सर्वथा गुण आनेपर गुणोंका अभिमान हो ही नहीं सकता। यहाँ दैवी-सम्पत्ति कहनेका तात्पर्य है कि यह भगवान्की सम्पत्ति है। अतः भगवान्का सम्बन्ध होनेसे, उनका आश्रय लेनेसे शरणागत भक्तमें यह स्वाभाविक ही आती है। जैसे शबरीके प्रसङ्गमें रामजीने कहा है --, नवधा भगति कहउँ तोहिं पाहीं। सावधान सुनु धरु मन माहीं।। नव महुँ एकउ जिन्ह कें होई। नारि पुरुष सचराचर कोई।। सोइ अतिसय प्रिय भामिनि मोरें। सकल प्रकार भगति दृढ़ तोरें।। (मानस 3। 35 -- 36) मनुष्य-देवता, भूत-पिशाच, पशु-पक्षी, नारकीय जीव, कीट-पतङ्ग, लता-वृक्ष आदि जितने भी स्थावर-जङ्गम प्राणी हैं, उन सबमें अपनी-अपनी योनिके अनुसार मिले हुए शरीरोंके रुग्ण एवं जीर्ण हो जानेपर भी 'मैं जीता रहूँ, मेरे प्राण बने रहें' -- यह इच्छा बनी रहती है (टिप्पणी प0 801)। इस इच्छाका होना ही आसुरी-सम्पत्ति है।त्यागी-वैरागी साधकमें भी प्राणोंके बने रहनेकी इच्छा रहती है; परन्तु उसमें प्राणपोषण-बुद्धि, इन्द्रिय-लोलुपता नहीं रहती; क्योंकि उसका उद्देश्य परमात्मा होता है, न कि शरीर और संसार।जब साधक भक्तका भगवान्में प्रेम हो जाता है, तब उसको भगवान् प्राणोंसे भी प्यारे लगते हैं। प्राणोंका मोह न रहनेसे उसके प्राणोंका आधार केवल भगवान् हो जाते हैं। इसलिये वह भगवान्को प्राणनाथ! प्राणेश्वर! प्राणप्रिय!' आदि सम्बोधनोंसे पुकारता है। भगवान्का वियोग न सहनेसे उसके प्राण भी छूट सकते हैं। कारण कि मनुष्य जिस वस्तुको प्राणोंसे भी बढ़कर मान लेता है, उसके लिये यदि प्राणोंका त्याग करना पड़े तो वह सहर्ष प्राणोंका त्याग कर देता है; जैसे -- पतिव्रता स्त्री पतिको प्राणोंसे भी बढ़कर (प्राणनाथ) मानती है, तो उसका प्राण, शरीर, वस्तु, व्यक्ति आदिमें मोह नहीं रहता। इसीलिये पतिके मरनेपर वह उसके वियोगमें प्रसन्नतापूर्वक सती हो जाती है। तात्पर्य यह हुआ कि जब केवल भगवान्में अनन्य प्रेम हो जाता है, तो फिर प्राणोंका मोह नहीं रहता। प्राणोंका मोह न रहनेसे आसुरी-सम्पत्ति सर्वथा मिट जाती है और दैवी-सम्पत्ति स्वतः प्रकट हो जाती है। इसी बातका संकेत गोस्वामी तुलसीदाजसी महाराजने इस प्रकार किया है -- प्रेम भगति जल बिनु रघुराई। अभिअंतर मल कबहुँ न जाई।।(मानस 7। 49। 3) सम्बन्ध--अबतक एक परमात्माका ही उद्देश्य रखनेवालोंकी दैवी-सम्पत्ति बतायी; परन्तु सांसारिक भोग भोगना और संग्रह करना ही जिनका उद्देश्य है, ऐसे प्राणपोषणपरायण लोगोंकी कौन-सी सम्पत्ति होती है -- इसे अब आगेके श्लोकमें बताते हैं।",

            "Hindi": "तेज यह केवल मुखमण्डल की ही आभा नहीं है? जो पौष्टिक आहार और पर्याप्त विश्राम से प्राप्त होती है। तेज शब्द से ज्ञानी पुरुष के मात्र शारीरिक सौन्दर्य या तेज से ही अभिप्राय नहीं है। अध्यात्म की आभा कोई ऐसा प्रभामण्डल नहीं है? जो ज्ञानी के मुख के चारों ओर अग्निवृत के समान जगमगाता हो। तत्त्वदर्शी ऋषि का तेज है? उसकी बुद्धि की प्रतिभा? नेत्रों में जगमगाता आनन्द? सन्तप्त हृदयों को शीतलता प्रदान करने वाली शान्ति की सुरभि? कर्मों में उसका अविचलित सन्तुलन? प्राणिमात्र के प्रति उसके हृदय में स्थित प्रेम का आनन्द और उसके अन्तरतम से प्रकाशित आनन्द का प्रकाश। यह तेज ही उस ऋषि के व्यक्तित्व का प्रबल आकर्षण होता है? जो प्रचुर शक्ति और उत्साह के साथ सब की सेवा करता है और उसी में स्वयं को धन्य समझता है।क्षमा जिस सन्दर्भ में इस गुण का उल्लेख किया गया है? उससे इसका अर्थ गाम्भीर्य बढ़ जाता है। सामान्य दुख और कष्ट? अपमान और पीड़ा को धैर्यपूर्वक सहन करनै की क्षमता ही क्षमा का सम्पूर्ण अर्थ नहीं है। बाह्य जगत् के अत्यधिक शक्तिशाली विरोध तथा उत्तेजित करने वाली परिस्थितयों के होने पर भी उनका सामना करने का सूक्ष्म कोटि का साहस और अविचलित शान्ति का नाम क्षमा है।धृति जब कोई व्यक्ति साहसपूर्वक जीना चाहता है? तब वह अपने जीवन में सदैव सुखद वातावरण? अनुकूल परिस्थितयाँ और अपने कार्य में सफलता के सहायक सुअवसरों को प्राप्त करने की अपेक्षा नहीं कर सकता है। सामान्यत? एक दुर्बल व्यक्तित्व के पुरुष को अचानक निराशा आकर घेर लेती है और वह कार्य को अपूर्ण ही छोड़कर अपने कार्य क्षेत्र से निवृत्त हो जाता है। अनेक लोग तो ऐसे समय हतोत्साह होकर कार्य को त्याग देते हैं? जब विजयश्री उन्हें वरमाला पहनाने को तत्पर हो रही होती है निश्चल भाव से कार्यरत रहने के लिए मनुष्य को एक अतिरिक्त शक्ति की आवश्यकता होती है? जिसके द्वारा वह अपनी क्लान्त और श्रान्त आस्था काे पोषित कर दृढ़ बना सकता है। पुन एक युक्त पुरुष में निहित वह गुप्त शक्ति है धृति अर्थात् धैर्य। श्रद्धा की शक्ति? लक्ष्य में आस्था? उद्देश्य की एकरूपता? आदर्श का स्पष्ट दर्शन और त्याग की साहसिक भावना ये सब वे शक्ति श्रोत हैं? जहाँ से धृति की बूंदें रिसती हुई प्रवाहित होकर श्रम? अवसाद एवं निराशा आदि का परिहार करती हैं।शौचम् (शुद्धि) यह शब्द न केवल अन्तकरण के विचारों एवं उद्देश्यों की शुद्धि को इंगित करता है? वरन् इसके द्वारा वातावरण की शुद्धि? अपने वस्त्रों की और वस्तुओं की स्वच्छता भी सूचित की गयी है। आन्तरिक शुद्धि पर ही अत्यधिक बल देने के फलस्वरूप हम अपने समाज में बाह्य शुद्धि की सर्वथा उपेक्षा की जाते हुए देखते हैं। वस्त्रों की तथा नगर की स्वच्छता हमारे राष्ट्र में दुर्लभ हो गयी है। यद्यपि हमारे धर्म में साधक के लिए शुद्धि और स्वच्छता इन दोनों को ही अपरिहार्य बताया गया है? तथापि धर्णप्राण भक्तगण भी इनके प्रति उदासीन ही दिखाई देते हैं।अद्रोह अहिंसा का अर्थ है? किसी को भी पीड़ा न पहुँचाना और अद्रोह का अर्थ है मन में कभी हिंसा का भाव न उठना। जैसे? कोई भी व्यक्ति कभी स्वप्न में भी स्वयं को पीड़ित करने का विचार नहीं करता? वैसे ही आत्मैकत्व का बोध प्राप्त पुरुष के मन में किसी के प्रति भी द्रोह की भावना नहीं आती? क्योंकि अन्य को कष्ट देने का अर्थ स्वयं को ही पीड़ित करना है।न अतिमानिता इसका अर्थ है स्वयं की पूजनीयता के विषय में अतिशयोक्ति पूर्ण विचार न रखना। अतिमान के नहीं होने पर मनुष्य स्वयं को तत्काल ही सहस्रों अपरिहार्य उत्तेजनाओं से तथा अनावश्यक उत्तरदायित्वों से मुक्त कर सकता है। गर्वमुक्त पुरुष के लिए जीवन पक्षी के पंख के समान भारहीन होता है? जबकि एक अतिमानी पुरुष के लिए अपना जीवन प्राणदण्ड की शूली के समान बन जाता है? जिसे अत्यन्त कष्टपूर्वक वहन करते हुए उसे चलना पड़ता है? जब कि वह शूली उसके कंधों के मांस को निर्दयतापूर्वक छील रही होती है।उपर्युक्त छब्बीस गुण दैवीसम्पदा से सम्पन्न व्यक्ति के स्वभाव का पूर्ण चित्रण करते हैं। पूर्णत्व प्राप्ति के सभी इच्छुक साधकों के मार्गदर्शन के रूप में इन गुणों का यहाँ उल्लेख किया गया है। जिस मात्रा में? उपर्युक्त दैवीगुणों के अनुरूप हम अपने जीवन को पुर्नव्यवस्थित करने में सक्षम होते हैं और जीवन की ओर देखने के अपने दृष्टिकोण में परिवर्तन ला सकते हैं? उसी मात्रा में हम अपनी शक्तियों के निष्प्रयोजक व्यय को अवरुद्ध कर उन्हें सुरक्षित रख सकते हैं। इन जीवन मूल्यों का सम्मान करते हुए उन्हें जीने का अर्थ ही सम्यक् जीवन पद्धति को अपनाना है।अब? आसुरी सम्पदा का वर्णन करते हैं",

            "Devnagri": "तेज यह केवल मुखमण्डल की ही आभा नहीं है? जो पौष्टिक आहार और पर्याप्त विश्राम से प्राप्त होती है। तेज शब्द से ज्ञानी पुरुष के मात्र शारीरिक सौन्दर्य या तेज से ही अभिप्राय नहीं है। अध्यात्म की आभा कोई ऐसा प्रभामण्डल नहीं है? जो ज्ञानी के मुख के चारों ओर अग्निवृत के समान जगमगाता हो। तत्त्वदर्शी ऋषि का तेज है? उसकी बुद्धि की प्रतिभा? नेत्रों में जगमगाता आनन्द? सन्तप्त हृदयों को शीतलता प्रदान करने वाली शान्ति की सुरभि? कर्मों में उसका अविचलित सन्तुलन? प्राणिमात्र के प्रति उसके हृदय में स्थित प्रेम का आनन्द और उसके अन्तरतम से प्रकाशित आनन्द का प्रकाश। यह तेज ही उस ऋषि के व्यक्तित्व का प्रबल आकर्षण होता है? जो प्रचुर शक्ति और उत्साह के साथ सब की सेवा करता है और उसी में स्वयं को धन्य समझता है।क्षमा जिस सन्दर्भ में इस गुण का उल्लेख किया गया है? उससे इसका अर्थ गाम्भीर्य बढ़ जाता है। सामान्य दुख और कष्ट? अपमान और पीड़ा को धैर्यपूर्वक सहन करनै की क्षमता ही क्षमा का सम्पूर्ण अर्थ नहीं है। बाह्य जगत् के अत्यधिक शक्तिशाली विरोध तथा उत्तेजित करने वाली परिस्थितयों के होने पर भी उनका सामना करने का सूक्ष्म कोटि का साहस और अविचलित शान्ति का नाम क्षमा है।धृति जब कोई व्यक्ति साहसपूर्वक जीना चाहता है? तब वह अपने जीवन में सदैव सुखद वातावरण? अनुकूल परिस्थितयाँ और अपने कार्य में सफलता के सहायक सुअवसरों को प्राप्त करने की अपेक्षा नहीं कर सकता है। सामान्यत? एक दुर्बल व्यक्तित्व के पुरुष को अचानक निराशा आकर घेर लेती है और वह कार्य को अपूर्ण ही छोड़कर अपने कार्य क्षेत्र से निवृत्त हो जाता है। अनेक लोग तो ऐसे समय हतोत्साह होकर कार्य को त्याग देते हैं? जब विजयश्री उन्हें वरमाला पहनाने को तत्पर हो रही होती है निश्चल भाव से कार्यरत रहने के लिए मनुष्य को एक अतिरिक्त शक्ति की आवश्यकता होती है? जिसके द्वारा वह अपनी क्लान्त और श्रान्त आस्था काे पोषित कर दृढ़ बना सकता है। पुन एक युक्त पुरुष में निहित वह गुप्त शक्ति है धृति अर्थात् धैर्य। श्रद्धा की शक्ति? लक्ष्य में आस्था? उद्देश्य की एकरूपता? आदर्श का स्पष्ट दर्शन और त्याग की साहसिक भावना ये सब वे शक्ति श्रोत हैं? जहाँ से धृति की बूंदें रिसती हुई प्रवाहित होकर श्रम? अवसाद एवं निराशा आदि का परिहार करती हैं।शौचम् (शुद्धि) यह शब्द न केवल अन्तकरण के विचारों एवं उद्देश्यों की शुद्धि को इंगित करता है? वरन् इसके द्वारा वातावरण की शुद्धि? अपने वस्त्रों की और वस्तुओं की स्वच्छता भी सूचित की गयी है। आन्तरिक शुद्धि पर ही अत्यधिक बल देने के फलस्वरूप हम अपने समाज में बाह्य शुद्धि की सर्वथा उपेक्षा की जाते हुए देखते हैं। वस्त्रों की तथा नगर की स्वच्छता हमारे राष्ट्र में दुर्लभ हो गयी है। यद्यपि हमारे धर्म में साधक के लिए शुद्धि और स्वच्छता इन दोनों को ही अपरिहार्य बताया गया है? तथापि धर्णप्राण भक्तगण भी इनके प्रति उदासीन ही दिखाई देते हैं।अद्रोह अहिंसा का अर्थ है? किसी को भी पीड़ा न पहुँचाना और अद्रोह का अर्थ है मन में कभी हिंसा का भाव न उठना। जैसे? कोई भी व्यक्ति कभी स्वप्न में भी स्वयं को पीड़ित करने का विचार नहीं करता? वैसे ही आत्मैकत्व का बोध प्राप्त पुरुष के मन में किसी के प्रति भी द्रोह की भावना नहीं आती? क्योंकि अन्य को कष्ट देने का अर्थ स्वयं को ही पीड़ित करना है।न अतिमानिता इसका अर्थ है स्वयं की पूजनीयता के विषय में अतिशयोक्ति पूर्ण विचार न रखना। अतिमान के नहीं होने पर मनुष्य स्वयं को तत्काल ही सहस्रों अपरिहार्य उत्तेजनाओं से तथा अनावश्यक उत्तरदायित्वों से मुक्त कर सकता है। गर्वमुक्त पुरुष के लिए जीवन पक्षी के पंख के समान भारहीन होता है? जबकि एक अतिमानी पुरुष के लिए अपना जीवन प्राणदण्ड की शूली के समान बन जाता है? जिसे अत्यन्त कष्टपूर्वक वहन करते हुए उसे चलना पड़ता है? जब कि वह शूली उसके कंधों के मांस को निर्दयतापूर्वक छील रही होती है।उपर्युक्त छब्बीस गुण दैवीसम्पदा से सम्पन्न व्यक्ति के स्वभाव का पूर्ण चित्रण करते हैं। पूर्णत्व प्राप्ति के सभी इच्छुक साधकों के मार्गदर्शन के रूप में इन गुणों का यहाँ उल्लेख किया गया है। जिस मात्रा में? उपर्युक्त दैवीगुणों के अनुरूप हम अपने जीवन को पुर्नव्यवस्थित करने में सक्षम होते हैं और जीवन की ओर देखने के अपने दृष्टिकोण में परिवर्तन ला सकते हैं? उसी मात्रा में हम अपनी शक्तियों के निष्प्रयोजक व्यय को अवरुद्ध कर उन्हें सुरक्षित रख सकते हैं। इन जीवन मूल्यों का सम्मान करते हुए उन्हें जीने का अर्थ ही सम्यक् जीवन पद्धति को अपनाना है।अब? आसुरी सम्पदा का वर्णन करते हैं",

            "English": "दम्भः hypocrisy, दर्पः arrogance, अभिमानः selfconceit, च and, क्रोधः wrath, पारुष्यम् harshness, एव even, च and, अज्ञानम् ignorance, च and, अभिजातस्य to the one born for, पार्थ O Partha, सम्पदम् state,,आसुरीम् demoniacal.Commentary: Dambha Hypocrisy. To pretend to be what one is not, to pretend to be religious and pious. It consists of bragging of ones own greatness. Religious hypocrisy is the worst form of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is a mixture of deceit and falsehood. Those who boast about their own merits will get demerit only.Darpa Arrogance. Pride of learning, wealth, high connection, etc. An arrogant man cannot endure to see his fellowmen happy. He is more and more enraged at the fortune of his fellowmen in the matter of learning, happiness and prosperity.Parushyam (in speech) To speak of the blind as having lotuslike eyes, of the ugly as beautiful, of a man of low birth as one of high birth and so on, usually with an ulterior, selfish or evil motive.Ajnanam Ignorance, misconception of ones duties. An ignorant man is blind as to what should be done and what should not be done. There is absence of discrimination. Just as a child will put anything it gets in its hands into its mouth, whether it is clean or dirty, so also is the condition of the ignorant man who is not able to discriminate between the Real and the unreal, the good and the evil, virtue and vice. He is on the path of destruction. He does not know the road that leads to Moskha or liberation. He is drowned in the ocean of this worldly existence.These are the six demonical alities. These evil alities constitute the satanic or demonical wealth. They are obstacles on the path of liberation.By addressing Arjuna as Partha, Lord Krishna implies that Arjuna has no demonical alities in him as he is born in a noble family and is the son of Pritha.People of Asuric nature have no faith. They dispute every doctrine. They deny the existence of God. They deny the cycle of the worldprocess, the Vedas and the laws of ethics. Sensual indulgence is their goal. They rob people and take away their neighbours wives. They kill people ruthlessly. They do not believe in reincarnation and in the other world. They have no idea of right conduct, purity and selfrestraint.Asuras are those persons who have waged war and who still wage war with the gods in heaven. Those who are endowed with Asuric tendencies or evil alities are Asuras or demons. They exist in abundance in this iron age. Kamsa was an Asura. Hiranyakasipu was an Asura.Even a man of university alitifactions and titles is a veritable Asura if he is endowed with evil tendencies or Asubha Vasanas.Esoterically, the war between the Asuras and the gods is the internal fight that is ever going on between the pure and the impure tendencies in man, between Sattva and RajasTamas."

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या -- दम्भः -- मान? बड़ाई? पूजा? ख्याति आदि प्राप्त करनेके लिये? अपनी वैसी स्थिति न होनेपर भी वैसी स्थिति दिखानेका नाम दम्भ है। यह दम्भ दो प्रकारसे होता है --,(1) सद्गुणसदाचारोंको लेकर -- अपनेको धर्मात्मा? साधक? विद्वान्? गुणवान् आदि प्रकट करना अर्थात् अपनेमें वैसा आचरण न होनेपर भी अपनेमें श्रेष्ठ गुणोंको लेकर वैसा आचरण दिखाना? थोड़ा होनेपर भी ज्यादा दिखाना? भोगी होनेपर भी अपनेको योगी दिखाना आदि दिखावटी भावों और क्रियाओंका होना -- यह सद्गुणसदाचारोंको लेकर दम्भ है।(2) दुर्गुणदुराचारोंको लेकर -- जिसका आचरण? खानपान स्वाभाविक अशुद्ध नहीं है? ऐसा व्यक्ति भी जिनके आचरण? खानपान अशुद्ध हैं -- ऐसे दुर्गुणीदुराचारी लोगोंमें जाकर उनको राजी करके अपनी इज्जत जमानेके लिये? मानआदर आदि प्राप्त करनेके लिये? अपने मनमें बुरा लगनेपर भी वैसा आचरण? खानपान कर बैठता है -- यह दुर्गुणदुराचारोंको लेकर दम्भ है।तात्पर्य यह है कि जब मनुष्य प्राण? शरीर? धन? सम्पत्ति? आदर? महिमा आदिको प्रधानता देने लगता है? तब उसमें दम्भ आ जाता है।दर्पः -- घमण्डका नाम दर्प है। धनवैभव? जमीनजायदाद? मकानपरिवार आदि ममतावाली चीजोंको लेकर अपनेमें जो बड़प्पनका अनुभव होता है? वह दर्प है। जैसे -- मेरे पास इतना धन है मेरा इतना बड़ा परिवार है मेरा इतना राज्य है मेरे पास इतनी जमानजायदाद है मेरे पीछे इतने आदमी हैं मेरी आवाजके पीछे इतने आदमी बोलते हैं मेरे पक्षमें बहुत आदमी हैं धनसम्पत्तिवैभवमें मेरी बराबरी कौन कर सकता है मेरे पास ऐसेऐसे पद हैं? अधिकार हैं संसारमें मेरा कितना यश? प्रतिष्ठा हो रही है मेरे बहुत अनुयायी हैं मेरा सम्प्रदाय कितना ऊँचा है मेरे गुरुजी कितने प्रभावशाली हैं आदिआदि।अभिमानः -- अहंतावाली चीजोंको लेकर अर्थात् स्थूल? सूक्ष्म और कारणशरीरको लेकर अपनेमें जो बड़प्पनका अनुभव होता है? उसका नाम अभिमान है (टिप्पणी प0 802.1)। जैसे -- मैं जातिपाँतिमें कुलीन हूँ मैं वर्णआश्रममें ऊँचा हूँ हमारी जातिमें हमारी प्रधानता है गाँवभरमें हमारी बात चलती है अर्थात् हम जो कह देंगे? उसको सभी मानेंगे हम जिसको सहारा देंगे? उस आदमीसे विरुद्ध चलनेमें सभी लोग भयभीत होंगे और हम जिसके विरोधी होंगे? उसका साथ देनेमें भी सभी लोग भयभीत होंगे राजदरबारमें भी हमारा आदर है? इसलिये हम जो कह देंगे? उसे कोई टालेगा नहीं हम न्यायअन्याय जो कुछ भी करेंगे? उसको कोई टाल नहीं सकता? उसका कोई विरोध नहीं कर सकता मैं बड़ा विद्वान् हूँ? मैं अणिमा? महिमा? गरिमा आदि सिद्धियोंको जानता हूँ? इसलिये सारे संसारको उथलपुथल कर सकता हूँ? आदिआदि।क्रोधः -- दूसरोंका अनिष्ट करनेके लिये अन्तःकरणमें जो जलनात्मक वृत्ति पैदा होती है? उसका नाम,क्रोध है।मनुष्यके स्वभावके विपरीत कोई काम करता है तो उसका अनिष्ट करनेके लिये अन्तःकरणमें उत्तेजना होकर जो जलनात्मक वृत्ति पैदा होती है? वह क्रोध है। क्रोध और क्षोभमें अन्तर है। बच्चा उद्दण्डता करता है? कहना नहीं मानता? तो मातापिता उत्तेजनामें आकर उसको ताड़ना करते हैं -- यह उनका क्षोभ (हृदयकी हलचल) है? क्रोध नहीं। कारण कि उनमें बच्चेका अनिष्ट करनेकी भावना होती ही नहीं? प्रत्युत बच्चेके हितकी भावना होती है। परंतु यदि उत्तेजनामें आकर दूसरेका अनिष्ट? अहित करके उसे दुःख देनेमें सुखका अनुभव होता है? तो यह क्रोध है। आसुरी प्रकृतिवालोंमें यही क्रोध होता है।क्रोधके वशीभूत होकर मनुष्य न करनेयोग्य काम भी कर बैठता है? जिसके फलस्वरूप स्वयं उसको पश्चात्ताप करना पड़ता है। क्रोधी व्यक्ति उत्तेजनामें आकर दूसरोंका अपकार तो करता है? पर क्रोधसे स्वयं उसका अपकार कम नहीं होता क्योंकि अपना अनिष्ट किये बिना क्रोधी व्यक्ति दूसरेका अनिष्ट कर ही नहीं सकता। इसमें भी एक मर्मकी बात है कि क्रोधी व्यक्ति जिसका अनिष्ट करता है? उसका किन्हीं दुष्कर्मोंका जो फल भोगरूपसे आनेवाला है? वही होता है अर्थात् उसका कोई नया अनिष्ट नहीं हो सकता परंतु क्रोधी व्यक्तिका दूसरेका अनिष्ट करनेकी भावनासे और अनिष्ट करनेसे नया पापसंग्रह हो जायगा तथा उसका स्वभाव भी बिगड़ जायगा। यह स्वभाव उसे नरकोंमें ले जानेका हेतु बन जायगा और वह जिस योनिमें जायगा? वहीं उसे दुःख देगा।क्रोध स्वयंको ही जलाता है (टिप्पणी प0 802.2)। क्रोधी व्यक्तिकी संसारमें अच्छी ख्याति नहीं होती? प्रत्युत निन्दा ही होती है। खास अपने घरके आदमी भी क्रोधीसे डरते हैं। इसी अध्यायके इक्कीसवें श्लोकमें भगवान्ने क्रोधको नरकोंका दरवाजा बताया है। जब मनष्यके स्वार्थ और अभिमानमें बाधा पड़ती है? तब क्रोध पैदा होता है। फिर क्रोधसे सम्मोह? सम्मोहसे स्मृतिविभ्रम? स्मृतिविभ्रमसे बुद्धिनाश और बुद्धिनाशसे मनुष्यका पतन हो जाता है (गीता 2। 62 -- 63)।पारुष्यम् -- कठोरताका नाम पारुष्य है। यह कई प्रकारका होता है जैसे -- शरीरसे अकड़कर चलना? टेढ़े चलना -- यह शारीरिक पारुष्य है। नेत्रोंसे टेढ़ामेढ़ा देखना -- यह नेत्रोंका पारुष्य है। वाणीसे कठोर बोलना? जिससे दूसरे भयभीत हो जायँ -- यह वाणीका पारुष्य है। दूसरोंपर आफत? संकट? दुःख आनेपर भी उनकी सहायता न करके राजी होना आदि जो कठोर भाव होते हैं? यह हृदयका पारुष्य है।जो शरीर और प्राणोंके साथ एक हो गये हैं? ऐसे मनुष्योंको यदि दूसरोंकी क्रिया? वाणी बुरी लगती है? तो उसके बदलेमें वे उनको कठोर वचन सुनाते हैं? दुःख देते हैं और स्वयं राजी होकर कहते हैं कि आपने देखा कि नहीं मैंने उसके साथ ऐसा कड़ा व्यवहार किया कि उसके दाँत खट्टे कर दिये अब वह मेरे साथ बोल सकता है क्या यह सब व्यवहारका पारुष्य है।स्वार्थबुद्धिकी अधिकता रहनेके कारण मनुष्य अपना मतलब सिद्ध करनेके लिये? अपनी क्रियाओंसे दूसरोंको कष्ट होगा? उनपर कोई आफत आयेगी -- इन बातोंपर विचार ही नहीं कर सकता। हृदयमें कठोर भाव होनेसे वह केवल अपना मतलब देखता है और उसके मन? वाणी? शरीर? बर्ताव आदि सब जगह कठोरता रहती है। स्वार्थभावकी बहुत ज्यादा वृत्ति बढ़ती है? तो वह हिंसा आदि भी कर बैठता है? जिससे उसके स्वभावमें स्वाभाविक ही क्रूरता आ जाती है। क्रूरता आनेपर हृदयमें सौम्यता बिलकुल नहीं रहती। सौम्यता न रहनेसे उसके बर्तावमें? लेनदेनमें स्वाभाविक ही कठोरता रहती है। इसलिये वह केवल दूसरोंसे रुपये ऐँठने? दूसरोंको दुःख देने आदिमें लगा रहता है। इनके परिणाममें मुझे सुख होगा या दुःख -- इसका वह विचार ही नहीं कर सकता।अज्ञानम् -- यहाँ अज्ञान नाम अविवेकका है। अविवेकी पुरुषोंको सत्असत्? सारअसार? कर्तव्यअकर्तव्य आदिका बोध नहीं होता। कारण कि उनकी दृष्टि नाशवान् पदार्थोंके भोग और संग्रहपर ही लगी रहती है। इसलिये (परिणामपर दृष्टि न रहनेसे) वे यह सोच ही नहीं सकते कि ये नाशवान् पदार्थ कबतक हमारे साथ रहेंगे और हम कबतक इनके साथ रहेंगे। पशुओंकी तरह केवल प्राणपोषणमें ही लगे रहनेके कारण वे क्या कर्तव्य है और क्या अकर्तव्य है -- इन बातोंको नहीं जान सकते और न जानना ही चाहते हैं।वे तात्कालिक संयोगजन्य सुखको ही सुख मानते हैं और शरीर तथा इन्द्रियोंके प्रतिकूल संयोगको ही दुःख मानते हैं। इसलिये वे उद्योग तो सुखके लिये ही करते हैं? पर परिणाममें उनको पहलेसे भी अधिक दुःख मिलता है (टिप्पणी प0 803.1)। फिर भी उनको चेत नहीं होता कि इसका हमारे लिये नतीजा क्या होगा वे तो मानबड़ाई? सुखआराम? धनसम्पत्ति आदिके प्रलोभनमें आकर न करनेलायक काम भी करने लग जाते हैं? जिनका नतीजा उनके लिये तथा दुनियाके लिये भी बड़ा अहितकारक होता है।अभिजातस्य पार्थ सम्पदमासुरीम् -- हे पार्थ ये सब आसुरी सम्पत्ति (टिप्पणी प0 803.2) को प्राप्त हुए मनुष्योंके लक्षण हैं। मरणधर्मी शरीरके साथ एकता मानकर मैं कभी मरूँ नहीं सदा जीता रहूँ और सुख भोगता रहूँ -- ऐसी इच्छावाले मनुष्यके अन्तःकरणमें ये लक्षण होते हैं।अठारहवें अध्यायके चालीसवें श्लोकमें भगवान्ने कहा है कि कोई भी साधारण प्राणी प्रकृतिके गुणोंके सम्बन्धसे सर्वथा रहित नहीं है। इससे सिद्ध होता है कि प्रत्येक जीव परमात्माका अंश होते हुए भी प्रकृतिके साथ सम्बन्ध लेकर ही पैदा होता है। प्रकृतिके साथ सम्बन्धका तात्पर्य है -- प्रकृतिके कार्य शरीरमें मैंमेरे का सम्बन्ध (तादात्म्य) और पदार्थोंमें ममता? आसक्ति तथा कामनाका होना। शरीरमें मैंमेरेका सम्बन्ध ही आसुरीसम्पत्तिका मूलभूत लक्षण है। जिसका प्रकृतिके साथ मुख्यतासे सम्बन्ध है? उसीके लिये यहाँ कहा गया है कि वह आसुरीसम्पत्तिको प्राप्त हुआ है।प्रकृतिके साथ सम्बन्ध जीवका अपना माना हुआ है। अतः वह जब चाहे इस सम्बन्धका त्याग कर सकता है। कारण कि जीव (आत्मा) चेतन तथा निर्विकार है और प्रकृति जड तथा प्रतिक्षण परिवर्तनशील है? इसलिये चेतनका जडसे सम्बन्ध वास्तवमें है नहीं? केवल मान रखा है। इस सम्बन्धको छोड़ते ही आसुरीसम्पत्ति सर्वथा मिट जाती है। इस प्रकार मनुष्यमें आसुरीसम्पत्तिको मिटानेकी पूरी योग्यता है। तात्पर्य है कि आसुरी सम्पत्तिको प्राप्त होते हुए भी वह प्रकृतिसे अपना सर्वथा सम्बन्धविच्छेद करके आसुरीसम्पत्तिको मिटा सकता है।प्राणोंमें मनुष्यका ज्योंज्यों मोह होता जाता है? त्योंहीत्यों आसुरीसम्पत्ति अधिक बढ़ती जाती है। आसुरीसम्पत्तिके अत्यधिक बढ़नेपर मनुष्य अपने प्राणोंको रखनेके लिये और सुख भोगनेके लिये दूसरोंका नुकसान भी कर देता है। इतना ही नहीं? दूसरोंकी हत्या कर देनेमें भी वह नहीं हिचकता।मनुष्य जब अस्थायीको स्थायी मान लेता है? तब आसुरीसम्पत्तिके दुर्गुणदुराचारोंके समूहकेसमूह उसमें आ जाते हैं। तात्पर्य है कि असत्का सङ्ग होनेसे असत् आचरण? असत् भाव और दुर्गुण बिना बुलाये तथा बिना उद्योग किये अपनेआप आते हैं? जो मनुष्यको परमात्मासे विमुख करके अधोगतिमें ले जानेवाले हैं। सम्बन्ध -- अब भगवान् दैवी और आसुरी -- दोनों प्रकारकी सम्पत्तियोंका फल बताते हैं।",

            "Devnagri": "व्याख्या -- दम्भः -- मान? बड़ाई? पूजा? ख्याति आदि प्राप्त करनेके लिये? अपनी वैसी स्थिति न होनेपर भी वैसी स्थिति दिखानेका नाम दम्भ है। यह दम्भ दो प्रकारसे होता है --,(1) सद्गुणसदाचारोंको लेकर -- अपनेको धर्मात्मा? साधक? विद्वान्? गुणवान् आदि प्रकट करना अर्थात् अपनेमें वैसा आचरण न होनेपर भी अपनेमें श्रेष्ठ गुणोंको लेकर वैसा आचरण दिखाना? थोड़ा होनेपर भी ज्यादा दिखाना? भोगी होनेपर भी अपनेको योगी दिखाना आदि दिखावटी भावों और क्रियाओंका होना -- यह सद्गुणसदाचारोंको लेकर दम्भ है।(2) दुर्गुणदुराचारोंको लेकर -- जिसका आचरण? खानपान स्वाभाविक अशुद्ध नहीं है? ऐसा व्यक्ति भी जिनके आचरण? खानपान अशुद्ध हैं -- ऐसे दुर्गुणीदुराचारी लोगोंमें जाकर उनको राजी करके अपनी इज्जत जमानेके लिये? मानआदर आदि प्राप्त करनेके लिये? अपने मनमें बुरा लगनेपर भी वैसा आचरण? खानपान कर बैठता है -- यह दुर्गुणदुराचारोंको लेकर दम्भ है।तात्पर्य यह है कि जब मनुष्य प्राण? शरीर? धन? सम्पत्ति? आदर? महिमा आदिको प्रधानता देने लगता है? तब उसमें दम्भ आ जाता है।दर्पः -- घमण्डका नाम दर्प है। धनवैभव? जमीनजायदाद? मकानपरिवार आदि ममतावाली चीजोंको लेकर अपनेमें जो बड़प्पनका अनुभव होता है? वह दर्प है। जैसे -- मेरे पास इतना धन है मेरा इतना बड़ा परिवार है मेरा इतना राज्य है मेरे पास इतनी जमानजायदाद है मेरे पीछे इतने आदमी हैं मेरी आवाजके पीछे इतने आदमी बोलते हैं मेरे पक्षमें बहुत आदमी हैं धनसम्पत्तिवैभवमें मेरी बराबरी कौन कर सकता है मेरे पास ऐसेऐसे पद हैं? अधिकार हैं संसारमें मेरा कितना यश? प्रतिष्ठा हो रही है मेरे बहुत अनुयायी हैं मेरा सम्प्रदाय कितना ऊँचा है मेरे गुरुजी कितने प्रभावशाली हैं आदिआदि।अभिमानः -- अहंतावाली चीजोंको लेकर अर्थात् स्थूल? सूक्ष्म और कारणशरीरको लेकर अपनेमें जो बड़प्पनका अनुभव होता है? उसका नाम अभिमान है (टिप्पणी प0 802.1)। जैसे -- मैं जातिपाँतिमें कुलीन हूँ मैं वर्णआश्रममें ऊँचा हूँ हमारी जातिमें हमारी प्रधानता है गाँवभरमें हमारी बात चलती है अर्थात् हम जो कह देंगे? उसको सभी मानेंगे हम जिसको सहारा देंगे? उस आदमीसे विरुद्ध चलनेमें सभी लोग भयभीत होंगे और हम जिसके विरोधी होंगे? उसका साथ देनेमें भी सभी लोग भयभीत होंगे राजदरबारमें भी हमारा आदर है? इसलिये हम जो कह देंगे? उसे कोई टालेगा नहीं हम न्यायअन्याय जो कुछ भी करेंगे? उसको कोई टाल नहीं सकता? उसका कोई विरोध नहीं कर सकता मैं बड़ा विद्वान् हूँ? मैं अणिमा? महिमा? गरिमा आदि सिद्धियोंको जानता हूँ? इसलिये सारे संसारको उथलपुथल कर सकता हूँ? आदिआदि।क्रोधः -- दूसरोंका अनिष्ट करनेके लिये अन्तःकरणमें जो जलनात्मक वृत्ति पैदा होती है? उसका नाम,क्रोध है।मनुष्यके स्वभावके विपरीत कोई काम करता है तो उसका अनिष्ट करनेके लिये अन्तःकरणमें उत्तेजना होकर जो जलनात्मक वृत्ति पैदा होती है? वह क्रोध है। क्रोध और क्षोभमें अन्तर है। बच्चा उद्दण्डता करता है? कहना नहीं मानता? तो मातापिता उत्तेजनामें आकर उसको ताड़ना करते हैं -- यह उनका क्षोभ (हृदयकी हलचल) है? क्रोध नहीं। कारण कि उनमें बच्चेका अनिष्ट करनेकी भावना होती ही नहीं? प्रत्युत बच्चेके हितकी भावना होती है। परंतु यदि उत्तेजनामें आकर दूसरेका अनिष्ट? अहित करके उसे दुःख देनेमें सुखका अनुभव होता है? तो यह क्रोध है। आसुरी प्रकृतिवालोंमें यही क्रोध होता है।क्रोधके वशीभूत होकर मनुष्य न करनेयोग्य काम भी कर बैठता है? जिसके फलस्वरूप स्वयं उसको पश्चात्ताप करना पड़ता है। क्रोधी व्यक्ति उत्तेजनामें आकर दूसरोंका अपकार तो करता है? पर क्रोधसे स्वयं उसका अपकार कम नहीं होता क्योंकि अपना अनिष्ट किये बिना क्रोधी व्यक्ति दूसरेका अनिष्ट कर ही नहीं सकता। इसमें भी एक मर्मकी बात है कि क्रोधी व्यक्ति जिसका अनिष्ट करता है? उसका किन्हीं दुष्कर्मोंका जो फल भोगरूपसे आनेवाला है? वही होता है अर्थात् उसका कोई नया अनिष्ट नहीं हो सकता परंतु क्रोधी व्यक्तिका दूसरेका अनिष्ट करनेकी भावनासे और अनिष्ट करनेसे नया पापसंग्रह हो जायगा तथा उसका स्वभाव भी बिगड़ जायगा। यह स्वभाव उसे नरकोंमें ले जानेका हेतु बन जायगा और वह जिस योनिमें जायगा? वहीं उसे दुःख देगा।क्रोध स्वयंको ही जलाता है (टिप्पणी प0 802.2)। क्रोधी व्यक्तिकी संसारमें अच्छी ख्याति नहीं होती? प्रत्युत निन्दा ही होती है। खास अपने घरके आदमी भी क्रोधीसे डरते हैं। इसी अध्यायके इक्कीसवें श्लोकमें भगवान्ने क्रोधको नरकोंका दरवाजा बताया है। जब मनष्यके स्वार्थ और अभिमानमें बाधा पड़ती है? तब क्रोध पैदा होता है। फिर क्रोधसे सम्मोह? सम्मोहसे स्मृतिविभ्रम? स्मृतिविभ्रमसे बुद्धिनाश और बुद्धिनाशसे मनुष्यका पतन हो जाता है (गीता 2। 62 -- 63)।पारुष्यम् -- कठोरताका नाम पारुष्य है। यह कई प्रकारका होता है जैसे -- शरीरसे अकड़कर चलना? टेढ़े चलना -- यह शारीरिक पारुष्य है। नेत्रोंसे टेढ़ामेढ़ा देखना -- यह नेत्रोंका पारुष्य है। वाणीसे कठोर बोलना? जिससे दूसरे भयभीत हो जायँ -- यह वाणीका पारुष्य है। दूसरोंपर आफत? संकट? दुःख आनेपर भी उनकी सहायता न करके राजी होना आदि जो कठोर भाव होते हैं? यह हृदयका पारुष्य है।जो शरीर और प्राणोंके साथ एक हो गये हैं? ऐसे मनुष्योंको यदि दूसरोंकी क्रिया? वाणी बुरी लगती है? तो उसके बदलेमें वे उनको कठोर वचन सुनाते हैं? दुःख देते हैं और स्वयं राजी होकर कहते हैं कि आपने देखा कि नहीं मैंने उसके साथ ऐसा कड़ा व्यवहार किया कि उसके दाँत खट्टे कर दिये अब वह मेरे साथ बोल सकता है क्या यह सब व्यवहारका पारुष्य है।स्वार्थबुद्धिकी अधिकता रहनेके कारण मनुष्य अपना मतलब सिद्ध करनेके लिये? अपनी क्रियाओंसे दूसरोंको कष्ट होगा? उनपर कोई आफत आयेगी -- इन बातोंपर विचार ही नहीं कर सकता। हृदयमें कठोर भाव होनेसे वह केवल अपना मतलब देखता है और उसके मन? वाणी? शरीर? बर्ताव आदि सब जगह कठोरता रहती है। स्वार्थभावकी बहुत ज्यादा वृत्ति बढ़ती है? तो वह हिंसा आदि भी कर बैठता है? जिससे उसके स्वभावमें स्वाभाविक ही क्रूरता आ जाती है। क्रूरता आनेपर हृदयमें सौम्यता बिलकुल नहीं रहती। सौम्यता न रहनेसे उसके बर्तावमें? लेनदेनमें स्वाभाविक ही कठोरता रहती है। इसलिये वह केवल दूसरोंसे रुपये ऐँठने? दूसरोंको दुःख देने आदिमें लगा रहता है। इनके परिणाममें मुझे सुख होगा या दुःख -- इसका वह विचार ही नहीं कर सकता।अज्ञानम् -- यहाँ अज्ञान नाम अविवेकका है। अविवेकी पुरुषोंको सत्असत्? सारअसार? कर्तव्यअकर्तव्य आदिका बोध नहीं होता। कारण कि उनकी दृष्टि नाशवान् पदार्थोंके भोग और संग्रहपर ही लगी रहती है। इसलिये (परिणामपर दृष्टि न रहनेसे) वे यह सोच ही नहीं सकते कि ये नाशवान् पदार्थ कबतक हमारे साथ रहेंगे और हम कबतक इनके साथ रहेंगे। पशुओंकी तरह केवल प्राणपोषणमें ही लगे रहनेके कारण वे क्या कर्तव्य है और क्या अकर्तव्य है -- इन बातोंको नहीं जान सकते और न जानना ही चाहते हैं।वे तात्कालिक संयोगजन्य सुखको ही सुख मानते हैं और शरीर तथा इन्द्रियोंके प्रतिकूल संयोगको ही दुःख मानते हैं। इसलिये वे उद्योग तो सुखके लिये ही करते हैं? पर परिणाममें उनको पहलेसे भी अधिक दुःख मिलता है (टिप्पणी प0 803.1)। फिर भी उनको चेत नहीं होता कि इसका हमारे लिये नतीजा क्या होगा वे तो मानबड़ाई? सुखआराम? धनसम्पत्ति आदिके प्रलोभनमें आकर न करनेलायक काम भी करने लग जाते हैं? जिनका नतीजा उनके लिये तथा दुनियाके लिये भी बड़ा अहितकारक होता है।अभिजातस्य पार्थ सम्पदमासुरीम् -- हे पार्थ ये सब आसुरी सम्पत्ति (टिप्पणी प0 803.2) को प्राप्त हुए मनुष्योंके लक्षण हैं। मरणधर्मी शरीरके साथ एकता मानकर मैं कभी मरूँ नहीं सदा जीता रहूँ और सुख भोगता रहूँ -- ऐसी इच्छावाले मनुष्यके अन्तःकरणमें ये लक्षण होते हैं।अठारहवें अध्यायके चालीसवें श्लोकमें भगवान्ने कहा है कि कोई भी साधारण प्राणी प्रकृतिके गुणोंके सम्बन्धसे सर्वथा रहित नहीं है। इससे सिद्ध होता है कि प्रत्येक जीव परमात्माका अंश होते हुए भी प्रकृतिके साथ सम्बन्ध लेकर ही पैदा होता है। प्रकृतिके साथ सम्बन्धका तात्पर्य है -- प्रकृतिके कार्य शरीरमें मैंमेरे का सम्बन्ध (तादात्म्य) और पदार्थोंमें ममता? आसक्ति तथा कामनाका होना। शरीरमें मैंमेरेका सम्बन्ध ही आसुरीसम्पत्तिका मूलभूत लक्षण है। जिसका प्रकृतिके साथ मुख्यतासे सम्बन्ध है? उसीके लिये यहाँ कहा गया है कि वह आसुरीसम्पत्तिको प्राप्त हुआ है।प्रकृतिके साथ सम्बन्ध जीवका अपना माना हुआ है। अतः वह जब चाहे इस सम्बन्धका त्याग कर सकता है। कारण कि जीव (आत्मा) चेतन तथा निर्विकार है और प्रकृति जड तथा प्रतिक्षण परिवर्तनशील है? इसलिये चेतनका जडसे सम्बन्ध वास्तवमें है नहीं? केवल मान रखा है। इस सम्बन्धको छोड़ते ही आसुरीसम्पत्ति सर्वथा मिट जाती है। इस प्रकार मनुष्यमें आसुरीसम्पत्तिको मिटानेकी पूरी योग्यता है। तात्पर्य है कि आसुरी सम्पत्तिको प्राप्त होते हुए भी वह प्रकृतिसे अपना सर्वथा सम्बन्धविच्छेद करके आसुरीसम्पत्तिको मिटा सकता है।प्राणोंमें मनुष्यका ज्योंज्यों मोह होता जाता है? त्योंहीत्यों आसुरीसम्पत्ति अधिक बढ़ती जाती है। आसुरीसम्पत्तिके अत्यधिक बढ़नेपर मनुष्य अपने प्राणोंको रखनेके लिये और सुख भोगनेके लिये दूसरोंका नुकसान भी कर देता है। इतना ही नहीं? दूसरोंकी हत्या कर देनेमें भी वह नहीं हिचकता।मनुष्य जब अस्थायीको स्थायी मान लेता है? तब आसुरीसम्पत्तिके दुर्गुणदुराचारोंके समूहकेसमूह उसमें आ जाते हैं। तात्पर्य है कि असत्का सङ्ग होनेसे असत् आचरण? असत् भाव और दुर्गुण बिना बुलाये तथा बिना उद्योग किये अपनेआप आते हैं? जो मनुष्यको परमात्मासे विमुख करके अधोगतिमें ले जानेवाले हैं। सम्बन्ध -- अब भगवान् दैवी और आसुरी -- दोनों प्रकारकी सम्पत्तियोंका फल बताते हैं।",

            "Hindi": "केवल एक श्लोक की परिसीमा में ही जगत् के कुरूप व्यक्तित्व के पुरुषों की कुरूपता का इतना बोधगम्य वर्णन इसके पूर्व कभी नहीं किया गया था। आसुरी प्रवृत्तियों के प्रकार अनेक हैं? परन्तु यहाँ केवल कुछ मुख्य दुर्गुणों का उल्लेख किया गया है? जिनके द्वारा हम उन समस्त आसुरी शक्तियों को समझ सकते हैं? जो कभी भी मनुष्य के हृदय में व्यक्त होकर अपना विनाशकारी प्रभाव दिखा सकती हैं। इन सबको जानने का लाभ यह होगा कि हम अपने हृदय से अवांछित प्रवृत्तियों को दूर कर सकते हैं? और इस प्रकार हमें अपने विकास के लिए एक महत् शक्ति उपलब्ध हो सकती है।दम्भ श्री शंकाराचार्य के अनुसार दम्भ का अर्थ है वास्तव में अधार्मिक होते हुए भी स्वयं को धार्मिक व्यक्ति के रूप में प्रकट करना। दूसरे शब्दों में? स्वयं को वस्तुस्थिति से अन्यथा प्रकट करना दम्भ है। यह अत्यन्त निम्नस्तर का रूप है? जिसे पापी? दुराचारी लोग धारण करते हैं। उनकी यह सतही साधुता और शुद्धता? धार्मिकता और निष्कपटता वस्तुत अपने घातक उद्देश्यों और दुष्ट संकल्पों को आवृत करने के आकर्षक आवरण हैं।दर्प धन? जन? यौवन? ज्ञान? सामाजिक प्रतिष्ठा इत्यादि का अत्याधिक गर्व (दर्प) मनुष्य को एक असह्य प्रकार की उच्चता प्रदान करता है। तत्पश्चात् वह मनुष्य जगत् की घटनाओं की ओर आत्मवंचक विपरीत ज्ञान के माध्यम से देखता है और अपने ही काल्पनिक आत्मसम्मान के जगत् में रहता है। फलत? इस दर्प के कारण? वह आन्तरिक शान्ति से वंचित रह जाता है। ऐसा मनुष्य अपने ही समाज के लोगों के प्रेम से निष्कासित हो जाता है। दर्प युक्त पुरुष जगत् में एकाकी रह जाता है। केवल काल्पनिक आत्मसम्मान और अपनी महानता के स्वप्न ही उसके मित्र होते हैं। उसके वैभव को केवल वही स्वयं देख पाता है और अन्य कोई नहीं। ऐसा पुरुष स्वाभाविक ही अभिमानी बन जाता है।क्रोध दम्भ? दर्प और अभिमान से युक्त पुरुष जब यह पाता है कि लोगों की उसके विषय में जो धारणायें हैं? वे उसकी अपनी धारणाओं से सर्वथा भिन्न हैं? तब उसका मन विद्रोह कर उठता है? जो प्रत्येक वस्तु की ओर क्रोध के रूप में प्रकट होता है। क्रोधावेश से अभिभूत ऐसे पुरुष के कर्मों और वाणी में लोगों को व्यग्र कर देने वाली कठोरता (पारुष्य) और धृष्टता का होना अनिवार्य है।उपर्युक्त दम्भ? दर्प आदि का एकमात्र कारण है आत्म अज्ञान। वह न स्वयं को जानता है और न अपने आसपास की जगत् की संरचना को जानता है। परिणाम यह होता है कि वह यह नहीं समझ पाता कि उसको जगत् के साथ किस प्रकार का सुखद सम्बन्ध रखना चाहिए। सारांशत? वह नितान्त अहंकार केन्द्रित हो जाता है और वह चाहता है कि बाह्य जगत् उसकी अपेक्षाओं और इच्छाओं के अनुकूल और अनुरूप रहे। इतना ही नहीं? अपितु वह अपने कार्यक्षेत्र के कार्यकर्ताओं के लिए एक मूर्खतापूर्ण आचारसंहिता प्रस्तुत करता है और अपेक्षा करता है कि वे ठीक उसी के अनुसार व्यवहार करें। स्वयं के तथा जगत् के विषय में यह जो अज्ञान है? यही वह गुप्त कारण है जिसके वशीभूत पुरुष समाज के विरुद्ध विद्रोह कर विक्षिप्त के समान व्यवहार करता है।यह है आसुरी सम्पदा अर्थात् असुरों के गुण। इस श्लोक में चित्रित आसुरी सम्पदा की पृष्ठभूमि में? पूर्व वर्णित दैवी सम्पदा अधिक आकर्षक ढंग से उजागर होती है।अब? इन दोनों प्रकार की सम्पदाओं के कार्य अर्थात् फल बताते हैं।",

            "Devnagri": "केवल एक श्लोक की परिसीमा में ही जगत् के कुरूप व्यक्तित्व के पुरुषों की कुरूपता का इतना बोधगम्य वर्णन इसके पूर्व कभी नहीं किया गया था। आसुरी प्रवृत्तियों के प्रकार अनेक हैं? परन्तु यहाँ केवल कुछ मुख्य दुर्गुणों का उल्लेख किया गया है? जिनके द्वारा हम उन समस्त आसुरी शक्तियों को समझ सकते हैं? जो कभी भी मनुष्य के हृदय में व्यक्त होकर अपना विनाशकारी प्रभाव दिखा सकती हैं। इन सबको जानने का लाभ यह होगा कि हम अपने हृदय से अवांछित प्रवृत्तियों को दूर कर सकते हैं? और इस प्रकार हमें अपने विकास के लिए एक महत् शक्ति उपलब्ध हो सकती है।दम्भ श्री शंकाराचार्य के अनुसार दम्भ का अर्थ है वास्तव में अधार्मिक होते हुए भी स्वयं को धार्मिक व्यक्ति के रूप में प्रकट करना। दूसरे शब्दों में? स्वयं को वस्तुस्थिति से अन्यथा प्रकट करना दम्भ है। यह अत्यन्त निम्नस्तर का रूप है? जिसे पापी? दुराचारी लोग धारण करते हैं। उनकी यह सतही साधुता और शुद्धता? धार्मिकता और निष्कपटता वस्तुत अपने घातक उद्देश्यों और दुष्ट संकल्पों को आवृत करने के आकर्षक आवरण हैं।दर्प धन? जन? यौवन? ज्ञान? सामाजिक प्रतिष्ठा इत्यादि का अत्याधिक गर्व (दर्प) मनुष्य को एक असह्य प्रकार की उच्चता प्रदान करता है। तत्पश्चात् वह मनुष्य जगत् की घटनाओं की ओर आत्मवंचक विपरीत ज्ञान के माध्यम से देखता है और अपने ही काल्पनिक आत्मसम्मान के जगत् में रहता है। फलत? इस दर्प के कारण? वह आन्तरिक शान्ति से वंचित रह जाता है। ऐसा मनुष्य अपने ही समाज के लोगों के प्रेम से निष्कासित हो जाता है। दर्प युक्त पुरुष जगत् में एकाकी रह जाता है। केवल काल्पनिक आत्मसम्मान और अपनी महानता के स्वप्न ही उसके मित्र होते हैं। उसके वैभव को केवल वही स्वयं देख पाता है और अन्य कोई नहीं। ऐसा पुरुष स्वाभाविक ही अभिमानी बन जाता है।क्रोध दम्भ? दर्प और अभिमान से युक्त पुरुष जब यह पाता है कि लोगों की उसके विषय में जो धारणायें हैं? वे उसकी अपनी धारणाओं से सर्वथा भिन्न हैं? तब उसका मन विद्रोह कर उठता है? जो प्रत्येक वस्तु की ओर क्रोध के रूप में प्रकट होता है। क्रोधावेश से अभिभूत ऐसे पुरुष के कर्मों और वाणी में लोगों को व्यग्र कर देने वाली कठोरता (पारुष्य) और धृष्टता का होना अनिवार्य है।उपर्युक्त दम्भ? दर्प आदि का एकमात्र कारण है आत्म अज्ञान। वह न स्वयं को जानता है और न अपने आसपास की जगत् की संरचना को जानता है। परिणाम यह होता है कि वह यह नहीं समझ पाता कि उसको जगत् के साथ किस प्रकार का सुखद सम्बन्ध रखना चाहिए। सारांशत? वह नितान्त अहंकार केन्द्रित हो जाता है और वह चाहता है कि बाह्य जगत् उसकी अपेक्षाओं और इच्छाओं के अनुकूल और अनुरूप रहे। इतना ही नहीं? अपितु वह अपने कार्यक्षेत्र के कार्यकर्ताओं के लिए एक मूर्खतापूर्ण आचारसंहिता प्रस्तुत करता है और अपेक्षा करता है कि वे ठीक उसी के अनुसार व्यवहार करें। स्वयं के तथा जगत् के विषय में यह जो अज्ञान है? यही वह गुप्त कारण है जिसके वशीभूत पुरुष समाज के विरुद्ध विद्रोह कर विक्षिप्त के समान व्यवहार करता है।यह है आसुरी सम्पदा अर्थात् असुरों के गुण। इस श्लोक में चित्रित आसुरी सम्पदा की पृष्ठभूमि में? पूर्व वर्णित दैवी सम्पदा अधिक आकर्षक ढंग से उजागर होती है।अब? इन दोनों प्रकार की सम्पदाओं के कार्य अर्थात् फल बताते हैं।",

The asuri, demoniacal nature; mata, is considered to be; nibandhaya, for inevitable bondage. So also is the fiendish nature. Now, when such a statement was made, the Lord, noticing Arjuna having this kind of inner cogitation-'Am I endowed with the demoniacal nature, or am I endowed with the divine nature?'-, says: ma, do not; sacah, grieve, O son of Pandu!

To Arjuna who, on hearing this, became alarmed and anxious about the classfication of his own nature, Sri Krsna said: 'Do not be grief-ridden.

Arjuna, on hearing the words of Lord Krishna, might have thought within himself, Do I possess divine nature or demoniacal nature The Lord, in order to remove Arjunas doubt, said, Grieve not, O Arjuna, thou art born with divine alities.

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या--'दैवी सम्पद्विमोक्षाय'--मेरेको भगवान्की तरफ ही चलना है -- यह भाव साधकमें जितना स्पष्टरूपसे आ जाता है, उतना ही वह भगवान्के सम्मुख हो जाता है। भगवान्के सम्मुख होनेसे,उसमें संसारसे विमुखता आ जाती है। संसारसे विमुखता आ जानेसे आसुरी-सम्पत्तिके जितने दुर्गुण-दुराचार हैं, वे कम होने लगते हैं और दैवी-सम्पत्तिके जितने सद्गुण-सदाचार हैं, वे प्रकट होने लगते हैं। इससे साधककी भगवान्में और भगवान्के नाम, रूप, लीला, गुण, चरित्र आदिमें रुचि हो जाती है। इसमें विशेषतासे ध्यान देनेकी बात है कि साधकका उद्देश्य जितना दृढ़ होगा, उतना ही उसका परमात्माके साथ जो अनादिकालका सम्बन्ध है, वह प्रकट हो जायगा और संसारके साथ जो माना हुआ सम्बन्ध है, वह मिट जायगा। मिट क्या जायगा, वह तो प्रतिक्षण मिट ही रहा है! वास्तवमें प्रकृतिके साथ सम्बन्ध है नहीं। केवल इस जीवने सम्बन्ध मान लिया है। इस माने हुए सम्बन्धकी सद्भावनापर अर्थात् 'शरीर ही मैं हूँ और शरीर ही मेरा है' -- इस सद्भावनापर ही संसार टिका हुआ है। इस सद्भावनाके मिटते ही संसारसे माना हुआ सम्बन्ध मिट जायगा और दैवी-सम्पत्तिके सम्पूर्ण गुण प्रकट हो जायँगे, जो कि मुक्तिके हेतु हैं। दैवी-सम्पत्ति केवल अपने लिये ही नहीं है, प्रत्युत मात्र प्राणियोंके कल्याणके लिये है। जैसे गृहस्थमें छोटे, बड़े, बूढ़े आदि अनेक सदस्य होते हैं, पर सबका पालन-पोषण करनेके लिये गृहस्वामी (घरका मुखिया) स्वयं उद्योग करता है, ऐसे ही संसारमात्रका उद्धार करनेके लिये भगवान्ने मनुष्यको बनाया है। वह मनुष्य और तो क्या, भगवान्की दी हुई विलक्षण शक्तिके द्वारा भगवान्के सम्मुख होकर, भगवान्की सेवा करके उन्हें भी अपने वशमें कर सकता है। ऐसा विचित्र अधिकार उसे दिया! है अतः मनुष्य उस अधिकारके अनुसार यज्ञ, दान, तप, तीर्थ, व्रत, जप, ध्यान, स्वाध्याय, सत्सङ्ग आदि जितना साधन-समुदाय है, उसका अनुष्ठान केवल अनन्त ब्रह्माण्डोंके अनन्त जीवोंके कल्याणके लिये ही करे और दृढ़तासे यह संकल्प रखते हुए प्रार्थना करे कि 'हे नाथ! मात्र जीवोंका कल्याण हो, मात्र जीव जीवन्मुक्त हो जायँ, मात्र जीव आपके अनन्य प्रेमी भक्त बन जायँ; पर 'हे नाथ! यह होगा केवल आपकी कृपासे ही। मैं तो केवल प्रार्थना कर सकता हूँ और वह भी आपकी दी हुई सद्बुद्धिके द्वारा ही!' ऐसा भाव रखते हुए अपनी कहलानेवाली शरीर, इन्द्रियाँ, मन, बुद्धि, धनसम्पत्ति आदि सभी चीजोंको मात्र दुनियाके कल्याणके लिये भगवान्के अर्पण कर दे (टिप्पणी प0 805.1)। ऐसा करनेसे अपनी कहलानेवाली चीजोंकी तो संसारके साथ और अपनी भगवान्के साथ स्वतःसिद्ध एकता प्रकट हो जायगी। इसे भगवान्ने 'दैवी सम्पद्विमोक्षाय' पदोंसे कहा है। 'निबन्धायासुरी मता'--जो जन्म-मरणको देनेवाली है, वह सब आसुरी-सम्पत्ति है। जबतक मनुष्यकी अहंताका परिवर्तन नहीं होता, तबतक अच्छे-अच्छे गुण धारण करनेपर वे निरर्थक तो नहीं जाते, पर उनसे उसकी मुक्ति हो जायगी -- ऐसी बात नहीं है। तात्पर्य यह है कि जबतक 'मेरा शरीर बना रहे, मेरेको सुख-आराम मिलता रहे' इस प्रकारके विचार अहंतामें बैठे रहेंगे, तबतक ऊपरसे भरे हुए दैवी-सम्पत्तिके गुण मुक्तिदायक नहीं होंगे। हाँ, यह बात तो हो सकती है कि वे गुण उसको शुभ फल देनेवाले हो जायँगे, ऊँचे लोक देनेवाले हो जायँगे, पर मुक्ति नहीं देंगे। जैसे बीजको मिट्टीमें मिला देनेपर मिट्टी, जल, हवा, धूप -- ये सभी उस बीजको ही पुष्ट करते हैं; आकाश भी उसे अवकाश देता है, बीजसे उसी जातिका वृक्ष पैदा होता है और उस वृक्षमें उसी जातिके फल लगते हैं। ऐसे ही अहंता-(मैं-पन-) में संसारके संस्काररूपी बीज रखते हुए जिस शुभ-कर्मको करेंगे, वह शुभ-कर्म उन बीजोंको ही पुष्ट करेगा और उन बीजोंके अनुसार ही फल देगा। तात्पर्य यह है कि सकाम मनुष्यकी अहंताके भीतर संसारके जो संस्कार प़ड़े हैं, उन संस्कारोंके अनुसार उसकी सकाम साधनामें अणिमा, गरिमा आदि सिद्धियाँ आयेंगी। उसमें और कुछ विशेषता भी आयेगी, तो वह ब्रह्मलोक आदि लोकोंमें जाकर वहाँके ऊँचे-ऊँचे भोग प्राप्त कर सकता है, पर उसकी मुक्ति नहीं होगी (गीता 8। 16)। अब प्रश्न यह होता है कि मनुष्य मुक्तिके लिये क्या करे ? उत्तर यह है कि जैसे बीजको भून दिया जाय या उबाल दिया जाय, तो वह बीज अङ्कुर नहीं देगा (टिप्पणी प0 805.2)। उस बीजको बोया जाय तो पृथ्वी उसको अपने साथ मिला लेगी। फिर यह पता ही नहीं चलेगा कि बीज था या नहीं! ऐसे ही मनुष्यका जब दृढ़ निश्चय हो जायगा कि मुझे केवल परमात्मप्राप्ति ही करनी है, तो संसारके सब बीज ( संस्कार) अहंतामेंसे नष्ट हो जायँगे। शरीर-प्राणोंमें एक प्रकारकी आसक्ति होती है कि मैं सुखपूर्वक जीता रहूँ, मेरेको मान-बड़ाई मिलती रहे, मैं भोग भोगता रहूँ, आदि। इस प्रकार जो व्यक्तित्वको रखकर चलते हैं, उनमें अच्छे गुण आनेपर भी आसक्तिके कारण उनकी मुक्ति नहीं हो सकती; क्योंकि ऊँच-नीच योनियोंमें जन्म लेनेका कारण प्रकृतिका सम्बन्ध ही है (गीता 13। 21)। तात्पर्य यह है कि जिसने प्रकृतिसे अपना सम्बन्ध जोड़ा हुआ है, वह शुभ-कर्म करके ब्रह्मलोकतक भी चला जाय तो भी वह बन्धनमें ही रहेगा। मार्मिक बात भगवान्ने इस अध्यायमें आसुरी-सम्पदाके तीन फल बताये हैं, जिनमेंसे इस श्लोकमें 'निबन्धायासुरी मता' पदोंसे बन्धनरूप सामान्य फल बताया है। दूसरे अध्यायके इकतालीसवेंसे चौवालीसवें श्लोकोंमें वर्णित और नवें अध्यायके बीसवें-इक्कीसवें श्लोकोंमें वर्णित सकाम उपासक भी इसीमें आ जाते हैं। जिनका उद्देश्य केवल भोग भोगना और संग्रह करना है, ऐसे मनुष्योंकी बहुत शाखाओंवाली अनन्त बुद्धियाँ होती हैं अर्थात् उनकी कामनाओंका कोई अन्त नहीं होता। जो कामनाओंमें तन्मय हैं और कर्मफलके प्रशंसक वेदवाक्योंमें ही प्रीति रखते हैं, वे वैदिक यज्ञादिको विधिविधानसे करते हैं, पर कामनाओंके कारण उनको जन्म-मरणरूप बन्धन होता है (गीता 2। 41 -- 44)। ऐसे ही जो यहाँके भोगोंको न चाहकर स्वर्गके दिव्य भोगोंकी कामनासे शास्त्रविहित यज्ञ करते हैं, वे यज्ञके फलस्वरूप (स्वर्गके प्रतिबन्धक पाप नष्ट होनेसे) स्वर्गमें जाकर दिव्य भोग भोगते हैं। जब उनके (स्वर्ग देनेवाले) पुण्य क्षीण हो जाते हैं, तब वे वहाँसे लौटकर आवागमनको प्राप्त हो जाते हैं (गीता 9। 20 -- 21)। अब यहाँ शङ्का यह होती है कि जिस कृष्णमार्ग (गीता 8। 25) से उपर्युक्त सकाम पुरुष जाते हैं, उसी मार्गसे योगभ्रष्ट पुरुष (गीता 6। 41) भी जाते हैं; अतः दोनोंका मार्ग एक होनेसे और दोनों पुनरावर्ती होनेसे सकाम पुरुषोंके समान योगभ्रष्ट पुरुषोंको भी 'निबन्धायासुरी मता' वाला बन्धन होना चाहिये। इसका समाधान यह है कि योगभ्रष्टोंको यह बन्धन नहीं होता। कारण कि पूर्व-(मनुष्यजन्ममें की हुई) साधनामें उनका उद्देश्य अपने कल्याणका रहा है और अन्त समयमें वासना, बेहोशी, पीड़ा आदिके कारण उनको विघ्नरूपसे स्वर्गादिमें जाना पड़ता है। अतः इन योगभ्रष्टोंके इस मार्गसे जानेके कारण ही (गीता 8। 25 में) सकाम पुरुषोंके लिये भी 'योगी' पद आया है, अन्यथा सकाम पुरुष योगी कहे ही नहीं जा सकते। आसुरी-सम्पत्तिका दूसरा फल है -- 'पतन्ति नरकेऽशुचौ' (गीता 16। 16)। जो कामनाके वशीभूत होकर पाप, अन्याय, दुराचार आदि करते हैं, उनको फलस्वरूप स्थानविशेष नरकोंकी प्राप्ति होती है। आसुरी-सम्पत्तिका तीसरा फल है -- 'आसुरीष्वेव योनिषु', 'ततो यान्त्यधमां गतिम्' (गीता 16। 19 -- 20)। जिनके भीतर दुर्गुण-दुर्भाव रहते हैं और कभी-कभी उनसे प्रेरित होकर वे दुराचार भी कर बैठते हैं, उनको दुर्गुण-दुर्भावके अनुसार पहले तो आसुरी योनिकी प्राप्ति और फिर दुराचारके अनुसार अधम गति-(नरकों) की प्राप्ति बतायी गयी है। 'मा शुचः सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातोऽसि पाण्डव' -- केवल अविनाशी परमात्माको चाहनेवालेकी दैवी-सम्पत्ति होती है, जिससे मुक्ति होती है और विनाशी संसारके भोग तथा संग्रहको चाहनेवालेकी आसुरी-सम्पत्ति होती है, जिससे बन्धन होता है -- इस बातको सुनकर अर्जुनके मनमें कहीं यह शङ्का पैदा न हो जाय कि मुझे तो अपनेमें दैवी-सम्पत्ति दीखती ही नहीं! इसलिये भगवान् कहते हैं कि 'भैया अर्जुन! तुम दैवी-सम्पत्तिको प्राप्त हुए हो; अतः शोकसंदेह मत करो। दैवीसम्पत्तिको प्राप्त हो जानेपर साधकके द्वारा कर्मयोग, ज्ञानयोग या भक्तियोगका साधन स्वाभाविक ही होता है। कर्तव्यपालनसे कर्मयोगीके और ज्ञानाग्निसे ज्ञानयोगीके सभी पाप नष्ट हो जाते हैं (गीता 4। 23, 37); परंतु भक्तियोगीके सभी पाप भगवान् नष्ट करते हैं (गीता 18। 66) और संसारसे उसका उद्धार करते हैं (गीता 12। 7)। 'मा शुचः' (टिप्पणी प0 806)--तीसरे श्लोकमें 'भारत' चौथे श्लोकमें 'पार्थ' और इस पाँचवें श्लोकमें 'पाण्डव'--इन तीन सम्बोधनोंका प्रयोग करके भगवान् अर्जुनको उत्साह दिलाते हैं कि 'भारत! तुम्हारा वंश बड़ा श्रेष्ठ है; पार्थ तुम उस माता(पृथा) के पुत्र हो? जो वैरभाव रखनेवालोंकी भी सेवा करनेवाली है पाण्डव तुम बड़े धर्मात्मा और श्रेष्ठ पिता(पाण्डु) के पुत्र हो। तात्पर्य है कि वंश? माता और पिता -- इन तीनों ही दृष्टियोंसे तुम श्रेष्ठ हो अतः तुम्हारेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति भी स्वाभाविक है। इसलिये तुम्हें शोक नहीं करना चाहिये। गीतामें दो बार 'मा शुचः' पद आये हैं -- एक यहाँ और दूसरा अठारहवें अध्यायके छाछठवें श्लोकमें। इन पदोंका दो बार प्रयोग करके भगवान् अर्जुनको समझाते हैं कि तुझे साधन और सिद्धि -- दोनोंके ही विषयमें चिन्ता नहीं करनी चाहिये। साधनके विषयमें यहाँ यह आश्वासन दिया कि तू दैवीसम्पत्तिको प्राप्त हुआ है और सिद्धिके विषय (18। 66) में यह आश्वासन दिया कि मैं तुझे सम्पूर्ण पापोंसे मुक्त कर दूँगा। तात्पर्य यह है कि साधकको अपने साधनमें जो कमियाँ दीखती हैं? उनको तो वह दूर करता रहता है? पर कमियोंके कारण उसके अन्तःकरणमें नम्रताके साथ एक निराशासी रहती है कि मेरेमें अच्छे गुण कहाँ हैं? जिससे साध्यकी प्राप्ति हो साधककी इस निराशाको दूर करनेके लिय भगवान् अर्जुनको साधकमात्रका प्रतिनिधि बनाकर उसे यह आश्वासन देते हैं कि तुम साधन और साध्यके विषयमें चिन्ताशोक मत करो? निराश मत होओ। दैवीसम्पत्तिवाले पुरुषोंका यह स्वभाव होता है कि उनके सामने अनुकूल या प्रतिकूल कोई भी परिस्थिति? घटना आये? उनकी दृष्टि हमेशा अपने कल्याणकी तरफ ही रहती है। युद्धके मौकेपर जब भगवान्ने अर्जुनका रथ दोनों सेनाओंके बीचमें खड़ा किया? तब उन सेनाओंमें खड़े अपने कुटुम्बियोंको देखकर अर्जुनमें कौटुम्बिक स्नेहरूपी मोह पैदा हो गया और वे करुणा तथा शोकसे व्याकुल होकर युद्धरूप कर्तव्यसे हटने लगे। उन्हें विचार हुआ कि युद्धमें कुटुम्बियोंको मारनेसे मुझे पाप ही लगेगा? जिससे मेरे कल्याणमें बाधा लगेगी। इन्हें मारनेसे हमें नाशवान् राज्य और सुखकी प्राप्ति तो हो जायगी? पर उससे श्रेय(कल्याण) की प्राप्ति रुक जायगी। इस प्रकार अर्जुनमें कुटुम्बका मोह और पाप(अन्याय? अधर्म) का भय -- दोनों एक साथ आ जाते हैं। उनमें जो कुटुम्बका मोह है? वह आसुरीसम्पत्ति है और पापके कारण अपने कल्याणमें बाधा लग जानेका जो भय है? वह दैवीसम्पत्ति है। इसमें भी एक खास बात है। अर्जुन कहते हैं कि हमने जो युद्ध करनेका निश्चय कर लिया है? यह भी एक महान् पाप है -- 'अहो बत महत्पापं कर्तुं व्यवसिता वयम्' (1। 45)। वे युद्धक्षेत्रमें भी भगवान्से बारबार अपने कल्याणकी बात पूछते हैं -- 'यच्छ्रेयः स्यान्निश्चितं ब्रूहि तन्मे' (2। 7) 'तदेंक वद निश्चित्य येन श्रेयोऽहमाप्नुयाम्' (3। 2) 'यच्छ्रेय एतयोरेकं तन्मे ब्रूहि सुनिश्चितम्' (5। 1)। यह उनमें दैवीसम्पत्ति होनेके कारण ही है। इसके विपरीत जिनमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति है? ऐसे दुर्योधन आदिमें राज्य और धनका इतना लोभ है कि वे कुटुम्बके नाशसे होनेवाले पापकी तरफ देखते ही नहीं (1। 38)। इस प्रकार अर्जुनमें दैवीसम्पत्ति आरम्भसे ही थी। मोहरूप आसुरीसम्पत्ति तो उनमें आगन्तुक रूपसे आयी थी? जो आगे चलकर भगवान्की कृपासे नष्ट हो गयी -- 'नष्टो मोहः स्मृतिर्लब्धा त्वत्प्रसादान्मयाच्युत' (18। 73)। इसीलिये यहाँ भगवान् कहते हैं कि भैया अर्जुन तू चिन्ता मत कर क्योंकि तू दैवीसम्पत्तिको प्राप्त है। अर्जुनको अपनेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति नहीं दीखती? इसलिये भगवान् अर्जुनसे कहते हैं कि तुम्हारेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति प्रकट है। कारण कि जो श्रेष्ठ पुरुष होते हैं? उनको अपनेमें अच्छे गुण नहीं दीखते और अवगुण उनमें रहते नहीं। अपनेमें गुण न दीखनेका कारण यह है कि उनकी गुणोंके साथ अभिन्नता होती है। जैसे आँखमें लगा हुआ अंजन आँखको नहीं दीखता क्योंकि वह आँखके साथ एक हो जाता है? ऐसे ही दैवीसम्पत्तिके साथ अभिन्नता होनेपर गुण नहीं दीखते। जबतक अपनेमें गुण दीखते हैं? तबतक गुणोंके साथ एकता नहीं हुई है। गुण तभी दीखते हैं? जब वे अपनेसे कुछ दूर होते हैं। अतः भगवान् अर्जुनको आश्वासन देते हैं कि तुम्हारेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वाभाविक है? भले ही वह तुम्हें न दीखे इसलिये तुम चिन्ता मत करो। मार्मिक बात भगवान्ने कृपा करके मानवशरीर दिया है? तो उसकी सफलताके लिये अपने भावों और आचरणोंका विशेष ध्यान रखना चाहिये। कारण कि शरीरका कुछ पता नहीं कि कब प्राण चले जायँ। ऐसी अवस्थामें जल्दीसेजल्दी अपना उद्धार करनेके लिये दैवीसम्पत्तिका आश्रय और आसुरीसम्पत्तिका त्याग करना बहुत आवश्यक है। दैवीसम्पत्तिमें देव शब्द परमात्माका वाचक है और उनकी सम्पत्ति दैवीसम्पत्ति कहलाती है --,'देवस्येयं दैवी।' परमात्माका ही अंश होनेसे जीवमें दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतःस्वाभाविक है। जब जीव अपने अंशी परमात्मासे विमुख होकर जड प्रकृतिके सम्मुख हो जाता है अर्थात् उत्पत्तिविनाशशील शरीरादि पदार्थोंका सङ्ग (तादात्म्य) कर लेता है? तब उसमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति आ जाती है। कारण कि काम? क्रोध? लोभ? मोह? दम्भ? द्वेष आदि जितने भी दुर्गुणदुराचार हैं? वे सबकेसब नाशवान्के सङ्गसे ही पैदा होते हैं। जो प्राणोंको बनाये रखना चाहते हैं? प्राणोंमें ही जिनकी रति है? ऐसे प्राणपोषणपरायण लोगोंका वाचक 'असुर' शब्द है -- 'असुषु प्राणेषु रमन्ते इति असुराः।' इसलिये मैं सुखपूर्वक जीता रहूँ -- यह इच्छा आसुरीसम्पत्तिका खास लक्षण है। दैवी और आसुरीसम्पत्ति सब प्राणियोंमें पायी जाती है (गीता 16। 6)। ऐसा कोई भी साधारण प्राणी नहीं है? जिसमें ये दोनों सम्पत्तियाँ न पायी जाती हों। हाँ? इसमें जीवन्मुक्त? तत्त्वज्ञ महापुरुष तो आसुरीसम्पत्तिसे सर्वथा रहित हो जाते हैं (टिप्पणी प0 807)? पर दैवीसम्पत्तिसे रहित कभी कोई हो ही नहीं सकता। कारण कि जीव देव अर्थात् परमात्माका सनातन अंश है। परमात्माका अंश होनेसे इसमें दैवीसम्पत्ति रहती ही है। आसुरीसम्पत्तिकी मुख्यता होनेसे दैवीसम्पत्ति दबसी जाती है? मिटती नहीं क्योंकि सत्वस्तु कभी मिट नहीं सकती। इसलिये कोई भी मनुष्य सर्वथा दुर्गुणीदुराचारी नहीं हो सकता? सर्वथा निर्दयी नहीं हो सकता? सर्वथा असत्यवादी नहीं हो सकता? सर्वथा व्यभिचारी नहीं हो सकता। जितने भी दुर्गुणदुराचार हैं? वे किसी भी व्यक्तिमें सर्वथा हो ही नहीं सकते। कोई भी? कभी भी? कितना ही दुर्गुणीदुराचारी क्यों न हो? उसके साथ आंशिक सद्गुणसदाचार रहेंगे ही। दैवीसम्पत्ति प्रकट होनेपर आसुरीसम्पत्ति मिट जाती है क्योंकि दैवीसम्पत्ति परमात्माकी होनेसे अविनाशी है और आसुरीसम्पत्ति संसारकी होनेसे नाशवान् है। सच्चिदानन्दस्वरूप परमात्माका अंश होनेसे मैं सदा जीता रहूँ अर्थात् कभी मरूँ नहीं मैं सब कुछ जान लूँ अर्थात् कभी अज्ञानी न रहूँ मैं सर्वदा सुखी रहूँ अर्थात् कभी दुःखी न होऊँ -- इस तरह सत्चित्आनन्दकी इच्छा प्राणिमात्रमें रहती है। पर उससे गलती यह होती है कि मैं रहूँ तो शरीरसहित रहूँ मैं जानकर बनूँ तो बुद्धिको लेकर जानकार बनूँ मैं सुख लूँ तो इन्द्रियों और शरीरको लेकर सुख लूँ -- इस तरह इन इच्छाओंको नाशवान् संसारसे ही पूरी करना चाहता है। इस प्रकार प्राणोंका मोह होनेसे आसुरीसम्पत्ति रहती ही है (टिप्पणी प0 808)। इसमें एक मार्मिक बात है कि प्राणीमें नित्यनिरन्तर रहनेकी इच्छा होती है? तो यह नित्यनिरन्तर रह सकता है और मैं मरूँ नहीं? यह इच्छा होती है? तो यह,मरता नहीं। जीता रहना अच्छा लगता है? तो जीते रहना इसका स्वाभाविक है और मरनेसे भय लगता है? तो मरना इसका स्वाभाविक नहीं है। ऐसे ही अज्ञान बुरा लगता है? तो अज्ञान इसका साथी नहीं है। दुःख बुरा लगता है? तो दुःख इसका साथी नहीं है। इससे सिद्ध होता है कि इसका स्वरूप सत् है। असत् इसका स्वरूप नहीं है। सत्स्वरूप होकर भी यह सत्को यह क्यों चाहता है कारण कि इसने नष्ट होनेवाले असत् शरीरादिको मैं तथा मेरा मान लिया है और उनमें आसक्त हो गया है। तात्पर्य यह कि असत्को स्वीकार करनेसे स्वयं सत् होते हुए भी सत्की इच्छा होती है जडताको स्वीकार करनेसे स्वयं ज्ञानस्वरूप होते हुए भी ज्ञानकी इच्छा होती है दुःखरूप संसारको स्वीकार करनेसे स्वयं सुखस्वरूप होते हुए भी सुखकी इच्छा होती है। पर उसकी पूर्ति भी असत्जडदुःखरूप संसारके द्वारा ही करना चाहता है। तादात्म्यके कारण यह शरीरको ही रखना चाहता है? बुद्धिसे ही ज्ञानी बनना चाहता है? शरीरसे ही श्रेष्ठ और सुखी बनना चाहता है? अपने नाम और रूपको ही स्थायी रखना चाहता है। अपने नामको तो मरनेके बाद भी स्थायी रखना चाहता है? इस प्रकार असत्के सङ्गसे आसुरीसम्पत्ति आती है। ऐसे ही असत्के सङ्गका त्याग करनेसे आसुरीसम्पत्ति नष्ट हो जाती है और दैवीसम्पत्ति प्रकट हो जाती है। जब सत्सङ्ग? स्वाध्याय आदिके द्वारा मनुष्यमें परमात्मप्राप्ति करनेका विचार होता है? तब वह इसके लिये दैवीसम्पत्तिको धारण करना चाहता है। दैवीसम्पत्तिको वह कर्तव्यरूपसे उपार्जित करता है कि मुझे सत्य बोलना है? मुझे अहिंसक बनना है? मुझे दयालु बनना है? आदिआदि। इस प्रकार जितने भी दैवीसम्पत्तिके गुण हैं? उन गुणोंको वह अपने बलसे उपार्जित करना चाहता है। यह सिद्धान्त है कि कर्तव्यरूपसे प्राप्त की हुई और अपने बल(पुरुषार्थ) से उपार्जित की हुई चीज स्वाभाविक नहीं होती? प्रत्युत कृत्रिम होती है। इसके अलावा अपने पुरुषार्थसे उपार्जित माननेके कारण अभिमान आता है कि मैं बड़ा सत्यभाषी हूँ? मैं बड़ा अच्छा आदमी हूँ? आदि। जितने भी दुर्गुणदुराचार हैं? सबकेसब अभिमानकी छायामें रहते हैं और अभिमानसे ही पुष्ट होते हैं। इसलिये अपने उद्योगसे किया हुआ जितना भी साधन होता है? उस साधनमें अहंकार ज्योंकात्यों रहता है और अहंकारमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति रहती है। अतः जबतक वह दैवीसम्पत्तिके लिये उद्योग करता रहता है? तबतक आसुरीसम्पत्ति छूटती नहीं। अन्तमें वह हार मान लेता है अथवा उसका उत्साह कम हो जाता है? उसका प्रयत्न मंद हो जाता है और मान लेता है कि यह मेरे वशकी बात नहीं है। साधककी ऐसी दशा क्यों होती है कारण कि उसने अभीतक यह जाना नहीं कि आसुरीसम्पत्ति मेरेमें कैसे आयी आसुरीसम्पत्तिका कारण है -- नाशवान्का सङ्ग। इसका सङ्ग जबतक रहेगा? तबतक आसुरीसम्पत्ति रहेगी ही। वह नाशवान्के सङ्गको नहीं छोड़ता? तो आसुरीसम्पत्ति उसे नहीं छोड़ती अर्थात् आसुरीसम्पत्ति से वह सर्वथा रहित नहीं हो सकता। इसलिये यदि वह दैवीसम्पत्तिको लाना चाहे? तो नाशवान् जडके सङ्गका त्याग कर दे। नाशवान्के सङ्गका त्याग करनेपर दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतः प्रकट होगी क्योंकि परमात्माका अंश होनेसे परमात्माकी सम्पत्ति उसमें स्वतःसिद्ध है? कर्तव्यरूपसे उपार्जित नहीं करनी है। इसमें एक और मार्मिक बात है। दैवीसम्पत्तिके गुण स्वतःस्वाभाविक रहते हैं। इन्हें कोई छोड़ नहीं सकता। इसका पता कैसे लगे जैसे कोई विचार करे कि मैं सत्य ही बोलूँगा तो वह उम्रभर सत्य बोल सकता है। परन्तु कोई विचार करे कि मैं झूठ ही बोलूँगा? तो वह आठ पहर भी झूठ नहीं बोल सकता। सत्य ही बोलनेका विचार होनेपर वह दुःख भोग सकता है? पर झूठ बोलनेके लिये बाध्य नहीं हो सकता। परन्तु झूठ ही बोलूँगा -- ऐसा विचार होनेपर तो खानापीना? बोलनाचलना तक उसके लिये मुश्किल हो जायगा। भूख लगी हो और झूठ बोले कि भूख नहीं है? तो जीना मुश्किल हो जायगा। यदि वह ऐसी प्रतिज्ञा कर ले कि झूठ बोलनेसे बेशक मर जाऊँ? पर झूठ ही बोलूँगा? तो यह प्रतिज्ञा सत्य हो जायगी। अतः या तो प्रतिज्ञाभङ्ग होनेसे सत्य आ जायगा या प्रतिज्ञा सत्य हो जायगी। सत्य कभी छूटेगा नहीं क्योंकि सत्य मनुष्यमात्रमें स्वाभाविक है। इस तरह दैवीसम्पत्तिके जितने भी गुण हैं? सबके विषयमें ऐसी ही बात है। वे तो नित्य रहनेवाले और स्वाभाविक हैं। केवल नाशवान्के सङ्गका त्याग करना है। नाशवान्का सङ्ग अनित्य और अस्वाभाविक है। आसुरीसम्पत्ति आगन्तुक है। दुर्गुणदुराचार बिलकुल ही आगन्तुक हैं। कोई आदमी प्रसन्न रहता है? तो लोग ऐसा नहीं कहते कि तुम प्रसन्न क्यों रहते हो पर कोई आदमी दुःखी रहता है? तब कहते हैं कि दुःखी क्यों रहते हो क्योंकि प्रसन्नता स्वाभाविक है और दुःख अस्वाभाविक (आगन्तुक) है। इसलिये अच्छे आचरण करनेवालेको कोई नहीं कहता कि तुम अच्छे आचरण क्यों करते हो पर बुरे आचरणवालेको सब कहते हैं कि तुम बुरे आचरण क्यों करते हो अतः सद्गुणसदाचार स्वतः रहते हैं और दुर्गुणदुराचार सङ्गसे आते हैं? इसलिये आगन्तक हैं। अर्जुनमें दैवीसम्पत्ति विशेषतासे थी। जब उनमें कायरता आ गयी? तब भगवान्ने आश्चर्यसे कहा कि तेरेमें यह कायरता कहाँसे आ गयी (2। 2 -- 3) तात्पर्य यह है कि अर्जुनमें यह दोष स्वाभाविक नहीं? आगन्तुक है। पहले उनमें यह दोष था नहीं। अर्जुन आगे कहते हैं कि जिससे मेरा निश्चित कल्याण हो? ऐसी बात कहिये (2। 7 3। 2 5। 1)। युद्धके प्रसङ्गमें भी अर्जुनमें मेरा कल्याण हो जाय यह इच्छा है। तो इससे प्रतीत होता है कि अर्जुनके स्वभावमें पहलेसे ही दैवीसम्पत्ति थी? नहीं तो उर्वशीजैसी अप्सराको एकदम ठुकरा देना कोई मामूली आदमीकी बात नहीं थी। वे अर्जुन विचार करते हैं कि मेरेको दैवीसम्पत्ति प्राप्त है कि नहीं मैं उसका अधिकारी हूँ कि नहीं अतः उसे आश्वासन देते हुए भगवान् कहते हैं कि तू शोक मत कर तू दैवीसम्पत्तिको प्राप्त है -- 'मा शुचः सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातोऽसि पाण्डव' (16। 5)। सत् (चेतन) और असत्(जड) के तादात्म्यसे अहम्भाव पैदा होता है। मनुष्य शुभ या अशुभ? कोई भी काम करता है? तो अपने अहंकारको लेकर करता है। जब वह परमात्माकी तरफ चलता है? तब उसके अहंभावमें सत्अंशकी मुख्यता होती है और जब संसारकी तरफ चलता है? तब उसके अहंभावमें नाशवान् असत्अंशकी मुख्यता होती है। सत्अंशकी मुख्यता होनेसे वह दैवीसम्पत्तिका अधिकारी कहा जाता है और असत्अंशकी मुख्यता होनेसे वह उसका अनधिकारी कहा जाता है। असत्अंशको मिटानेके लिये ही मानवशरीर मिला है। अतः मनुष्य निर्बल नहीं है? पराधीन नहीं है? प्रत्युत यह सर्वथा सबल है? स्वाधीन है। नाशवान्? असत्अंश तो सबका मिटता ही रहता है? पर वह उससे अपना सम्बन्ध बनाये रखता है। यह भूल होती है। नाशवान्से सम्बन्ध बनाये रखनेके कारण आसुरीसम्पत्तिका सर्वथा अभाव नहीं होता। अहंभाव नाशवान्? असत्के सम्बन्धसे ही होता है। असत्का सम्बन्ध मिटते ही अहंभाव मिट जाता है। प्रकृतिके अंशको पकड़नेसे ही अहंभाव है। अहम्में जडचेतन दोनों हैं। तादात्म्य होनेसे पुरुष(चेतन) ने जडके साथ अपनेको एक मान लिया। भोगपदार्थोंकी सब इच्छाएँ असत्अंशमें ही रहती हैं। परन्तु सुखदुःखके भोक्तापनमें पुरुष हेतु बनता है -- 'पुरुषः सुखदुःखानां भोक्तृत्वे हेतुरुच्यते' (13। 20)। वास्तवमें हेतु है नहीं क्योंकि वह प्रकृतिस्थ होनेसे ही भोक्ता बनता है -- 'पुरुषः प्रकृतिस्थो हि भुङ्क्ते' (13। 21)। अतः सुखदुःखरूप जो विकार होता है? वह मुख्यताके जडअंशमें ही होता है। परन्तु तादात्म्य होनेसे उसका परिणाम ज्ञाता चेतनपर होता है कि मैं सुखी हूँ? मैं दुःखी हूँ। जैसे विवाह होनेपर स्त्रीकी जो आवश्यकता होती है? वह अपनी आवश्यकता कहलाती है। पुरुष जो गहने आदि खरीदता है? वह स्त्रीके सम्बन्धसे ही (स्त्रीके लिये) खरीदता है? नहीं तो उसे अपने लिये गहने आदिकी आवश्यकता नहीं है। ऐसे ही जडअंशके सम्बन्धसे ही चेतनमें जडकी इच्छा और जडका भोग होता है। जडका भोग जडअंशमें ही होता है? पर जडसे तादात्म्य होनेसे भोगका परिणाम केवल जडमें नहीं हो सकता अर्थात् सुखदुःखका भोक्ता केवल जडअंश नहीं बन सकता। परिणामका ज्ञाता चेतन ही भोक्ता बनता है। जितनी क्रियाएँ होती हैं? सब प्रकृतिमें होती हैं (3। 27 13। 29)? पर तादात्म्यके कारण चेतन उन्हें अपनेमें मान लेता है कि मैं कर्ता हूँ। तादात्म्यमें चेतन (परमात्मा) की इच्छामें चेतनकी मुख्यता और जड(संसार) की इच्छामें जडकी मुख्यता रहती है। जब चेतनकी मुख्यता रहती है? तब दैवीसम्पत्ति आती है और जब जडकी मुख्यता रहती है? तब आसुरीसम्पत्ति आती है। जडसे तादात्म्य रहनेपर भी सत्? चित् और आनन्दकी इच्छा चेतनमें ही रहती है। संसारकी ऐसी कोई इच्छा नहीं है? जो इन तीन (सदा रहना? सब कुछ जानना और सदा सुखी रहना),इच्छाओंमें सम्मिलित न हो। इससे गलती यह होती है कि इन इच्छाओंकी पूर्ति जड(संसार) के द्वारा करना चाहता है। जडको और आसुरीसम्पत्तिको स्वयं(चेतन) ने स्वीकार किया है। जडमें यह ताकत नहीं है कि वह स्वयंके साथ स्थिर रह जाय। जडमें तो हरदम परिवर्तन होता रहता है। चेतन उसको न पकड़े? तो वह अपनेआप छूट जायगा। कारण कि चेतनमें कभी विकार नहीं होता। वह सदा ज्योंकात्यों रहता है। पर असत् प्रकृति नित्यनिरन्तर? हरदम बदलती रहती है। वह कभी एकरूप रह ही नहीं सकती। चेतनने प्रकृतिके साथ सम्बन्ध स्वीकार कर लिया। उस सम्बन्धकी सत्ता यह मैं और मेरेरूपसे स्वीकार कर लेता है। अतः जडका सम्बन्ध और उससे पैदा होनेवाली आसुरीसम्पत्ति आगन्तुक है। यदि यह स्वयंमें होती? तो इसका कभी नाश नहीं होता क्योंकि स्वयंका कभी नाश नहीं होता और आसुरीसम्पत्तिके त्यागकी बात ही नहीं होती। अनित्य होनेपर भी चेतनके सम्बन्धसे यह नित्य दीखने लगती है। अविनाशीके सम्बन्धसे विनाशी भी अविनाशीकी तरह दीखने लगता है। इसलिये जिस मनुष्यमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति होती है? वह आसुरीसम्पत्तिका त्याग कर सकता है? और कल्याणका आचरण करके परमात्माको प्राप्त हो सकता है (16। 22)।परमात्माके सम्मुख होते ही आसुरीसम्पत्ति मिटने लगती है -- 'सनमुख होइ जीव मोहि जबहीं'। जन्म कोटि अघ नासहिं तबहीं।।(मानस 5। 44। 1) कारण कि जन्म कोटि अघ प्रकृतिसे सम्बन्ध स्वीकार करनेसे ही हुए हैं। प्रकृतिको स्वीकार न करें? तो फिर कैसे जन्ममरण होगा जन्ममरणमें कारण प्रकृतिसे सम्बन्ध ही है -- 'कारणं गुणसङ्गोऽस्य सदसद्योनिजन्मसु' (गीता 13। 21)। परन्तु जीवात्मा प्रकृतिकी क्रियाको अपनेमें मान लेता है? और प्रकृतिके कार्य शरीरमें मैंमेरापन कर लेता है? जिससे जन्मतामरता रहता है। वास्तवमें यह कर्ता भी नहीं है और लिप्त भी नहीं है -- 'शरीरस्थोऽपि कौन्तये न करोति न लिप्यते' (13। 31)। इस वास्तविकताका अनुभव करना ही कर्ममें अकर्म तथा अकर्ममें कर्म देखना है। इन दोनों बातोंका अभिप्राय यह है कि कर्म करते हुए भी यह सर्वथा निर्लिप्त तथा अकर्ता है और निर्लिप्त तथा अकर्ता रहते हुए ही यह कर्म करता है अर्थात् कर्म करते समय और कर्म न करते समय यह (आत्मा) नित्यनिरन्तर निर्लिप्त तथा अकर्ता रहता है। इस वास्तविकताका अनुभव करनेवाला ही मनुष्योंमें बुद्धिमान् है (4। 18)। जिसमें कर्तापनका भाव नहीं है और जिसकी बुद्धिमें लिप्तता नहीं है अर्थात् कोई भी कामना नहीं है? वह यदि सब प्राणियोंको मार दे? तो भी पाप नहीं लगता ( 18। 17)। अर्जुनने पूछा कि मनुष्य किससे प्रेरित होकर पाप करता है तो भगवान्ने कहा -- कामनासे (3। 36 -- 37)। कामनाके कारण ही सब पाप होते हैं। शरीरके तादात्म्यसे भोग और संग्रहकी कामना होती है (टिप्पणी प0 810)। अतः जडका सङ्ग (महत्त्व) ही सम्पूर्ण पापोंका -- आसुरीसम्पत्तिका कारण है। जडका सङ्ग न हो? तो दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतःसिद्ध है। अर्जुन साधकमात्रके प्रतिनिधि हैं। इसलिये अर्जुनके निमित्तसे भगवान् साधकमात्रको आश्वासन देते हैं कि चिन्ता मत करो अपनेमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति दीख जाय? तो घबराओ मत क्योंकि तुम्हारेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतःस्वाभाविक विद्यमान है -- 'मा शुचः सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातोऽसि पाण्डव'।।(16। 5) तात्पर्य यह हुआ कि साधकको पारमार्थिक उन्नतिसे कभी निराश नहीं होना चाहिये क्योंकि परमात्माका ही,अंश होनेसे मनुष्यमात्रमें परमात्माकी सम्पत्ति (दैवीसम्पत्ति) रहती ही है। परमात्मप्राप्तिका ही उद्देश्य होनेसे दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतः प्रकट हो जाती है। परमात्माका अंश होनेके नाते साधकको परमात्मप्राप्तिसे कभी निराश नहीं होना चाहिये क्योंकि परमात्माने कृपा करके मनुष्यशरीर अपनी प्राप्तिके लिये ही दिया है। इसलिये परमात्माका संकल्प तो हमारे कल्याणका ही है। यदि हम अपना अलग कोई संकल्प न रखें? प्रत्युत परमात्माके संकल्पमें ही अपना संकल्प मिला दें? तो फिर उनकी कृपासे स्वतः कल्याण हो ही जाता है। सम्बन्ध--सम्पूर्ण प्राणियोंमें चेतन और जड -- दोनों अंश रहते हैं। उनमेंसे कई प्राणियोंका जडतासे विमुख होकर चेतन(परमात्मा) की ओर मुख्यतासे लक्ष्य रहता है और कई प्राणियोंका चेतनसे विमुख होकर जडता(भोग और संग्रह) की ओर मुख्यतासे लक्ष्य रहता है। इस प्रकार चेतन और जडकी मुख्यताको लेकर प्राणियोंके दो भेद हो जाते हैं? जिनको भगवान् आगेके श्लोकमें बताते हैं।",

            "Devnagri": "व्याख्या--'दैवी सम्पद्विमोक्षाय'--मेरेको भगवान्की तरफ ही चलना है -- यह भाव साधकमें जितना स्पष्टरूपसे आ जाता है, उतना ही वह भगवान्के सम्मुख हो जाता है। भगवान्के सम्मुख होनेसे,उसमें संसारसे विमुखता आ जाती है। संसारसे विमुखता आ जानेसे आसुरी-सम्पत्तिके जितने दुर्गुण-दुराचार हैं, वे कम होने लगते हैं और दैवी-सम्पत्तिके जितने सद्गुण-सदाचार हैं, वे प्रकट होने लगते हैं। इससे साधककी भगवान्में और भगवान्के नाम, रूप, लीला, गुण, चरित्र आदिमें रुचि हो जाती है। इसमें विशेषतासे ध्यान देनेकी बात है कि साधकका उद्देश्य जितना दृढ़ होगा, उतना ही उसका परमात्माके साथ जो अनादिकालका सम्बन्ध है, वह प्रकट हो जायगा और संसारके साथ जो माना हुआ सम्बन्ध है, वह मिट जायगा। मिट क्या जायगा, वह तो प्रतिक्षण मिट ही रहा है! वास्तवमें प्रकृतिके साथ सम्बन्ध है नहीं। केवल इस जीवने सम्बन्ध मान लिया है। इस माने हुए सम्बन्धकी सद्भावनापर अर्थात् 'शरीर ही मैं हूँ और शरीर ही मेरा है' -- इस सद्भावनापर ही संसार टिका हुआ है। इस सद्भावनाके मिटते ही संसारसे माना हुआ सम्बन्ध मिट जायगा और दैवी-सम्पत्तिके सम्पूर्ण गुण प्रकट हो जायँगे, जो कि मुक्तिके हेतु हैं। दैवी-सम्पत्ति केवल अपने लिये ही नहीं है, प्रत्युत मात्र प्राणियोंके कल्याणके लिये है। जैसे गृहस्थमें छोटे, बड़े, बूढ़े आदि अनेक सदस्य होते हैं, पर सबका पालन-पोषण करनेके लिये गृहस्वामी (घरका मुखिया) स्वयं उद्योग करता है, ऐसे ही संसारमात्रका उद्धार करनेके लिये भगवान्ने मनुष्यको बनाया है। वह मनुष्य और तो क्या, भगवान्की दी हुई विलक्षण शक्तिके द्वारा भगवान्के सम्मुख होकर, भगवान्की सेवा करके उन्हें भी अपने वशमें कर सकता है। ऐसा विचित्र अधिकार उसे दिया! है अतः मनुष्य उस अधिकारके अनुसार यज्ञ, दान, तप, तीर्थ, व्रत, जप, ध्यान, स्वाध्याय, सत्सङ्ग आदि जितना साधन-समुदाय है, उसका अनुष्ठान केवल अनन्त ब्रह्माण्डोंके अनन्त जीवोंके कल्याणके लिये ही करे और दृढ़तासे यह संकल्प रखते हुए प्रार्थना करे कि 'हे नाथ! मात्र जीवोंका कल्याण हो, मात्र जीव जीवन्मुक्त हो जायँ, मात्र जीव आपके अनन्य प्रेमी भक्त बन जायँ; पर 'हे नाथ! यह होगा केवल आपकी कृपासे ही। मैं तो केवल प्रार्थना कर सकता हूँ और वह भी आपकी दी हुई सद्बुद्धिके द्वारा ही!' ऐसा भाव रखते हुए अपनी कहलानेवाली शरीर, इन्द्रियाँ, मन, बुद्धि, धनसम्पत्ति आदि सभी चीजोंको मात्र दुनियाके कल्याणके लिये भगवान्के अर्पण कर दे (टिप्पणी प0 805.1)। ऐसा करनेसे अपनी कहलानेवाली चीजोंकी तो संसारके साथ और अपनी भगवान्के साथ स्वतःसिद्ध एकता प्रकट हो जायगी। इसे भगवान्ने 'दैवी सम्पद्विमोक्षाय' पदोंसे कहा है। 'निबन्धायासुरी मता'--जो जन्म-मरणको देनेवाली है, वह सब आसुरी-सम्पत्ति है। जबतक मनुष्यकी अहंताका परिवर्तन नहीं होता, तबतक अच्छे-अच्छे गुण धारण करनेपर वे निरर्थक तो नहीं जाते, पर उनसे उसकी मुक्ति हो जायगी -- ऐसी बात नहीं है। तात्पर्य यह है कि जबतक 'मेरा शरीर बना रहे, मेरेको सुख-आराम मिलता रहे' इस प्रकारके विचार अहंतामें बैठे रहेंगे, तबतक ऊपरसे भरे हुए दैवी-सम्पत्तिके गुण मुक्तिदायक नहीं होंगे। हाँ, यह बात तो हो सकती है कि वे गुण उसको शुभ फल देनेवाले हो जायँगे, ऊँचे लोक देनेवाले हो जायँगे, पर मुक्ति नहीं देंगे। जैसे बीजको मिट्टीमें मिला देनेपर मिट्टी, जल, हवा, धूप -- ये सभी उस बीजको ही पुष्ट करते हैं; आकाश भी उसे अवकाश देता है, बीजसे उसी जातिका वृक्ष पैदा होता है और उस वृक्षमें उसी जातिके फल लगते हैं। ऐसे ही अहंता-(मैं-पन-) में संसारके संस्काररूपी बीज रखते हुए जिस शुभ-कर्मको करेंगे, वह शुभ-कर्म उन बीजोंको ही पुष्ट करेगा और उन बीजोंके अनुसार ही फल देगा। तात्पर्य यह है कि सकाम मनुष्यकी अहंताके भीतर संसारके जो संस्कार प़ड़े हैं, उन संस्कारोंके अनुसार उसकी सकाम साधनामें अणिमा, गरिमा आदि सिद्धियाँ आयेंगी। उसमें और कुछ विशेषता भी आयेगी, तो वह ब्रह्मलोक आदि लोकोंमें जाकर वहाँके ऊँचे-ऊँचे भोग प्राप्त कर सकता है, पर उसकी मुक्ति नहीं होगी (गीता 8। 16)। अब प्रश्न यह होता है कि मनुष्य मुक्तिके लिये क्या करे ? उत्तर यह है कि जैसे बीजको भून दिया जाय या उबाल दिया जाय, तो वह बीज अङ्कुर नहीं देगा (टिप्पणी प0 805.2)। उस बीजको बोया जाय तो पृथ्वी उसको अपने साथ मिला लेगी। फिर यह पता ही नहीं चलेगा कि बीज था या नहीं! ऐसे ही मनुष्यका जब दृढ़ निश्चय हो जायगा कि मुझे केवल परमात्मप्राप्ति ही करनी है, तो संसारके सब बीज ( संस्कार) अहंतामेंसे नष्ट हो जायँगे। शरीर-प्राणोंमें एक प्रकारकी आसक्ति होती है कि मैं सुखपूर्वक जीता रहूँ, मेरेको मान-बड़ाई मिलती रहे, मैं भोग भोगता रहूँ, आदि। इस प्रकार जो व्यक्तित्वको रखकर चलते हैं, उनमें अच्छे गुण आनेपर भी आसक्तिके कारण उनकी मुक्ति नहीं हो सकती; क्योंकि ऊँच-नीच योनियोंमें जन्म लेनेका कारण प्रकृतिका सम्बन्ध ही है (गीता 13। 21)। तात्पर्य यह है कि जिसने प्रकृतिसे अपना सम्बन्ध जोड़ा हुआ है, वह शुभ-कर्म करके ब्रह्मलोकतक भी चला जाय तो भी वह बन्धनमें ही रहेगा। मार्मिक बात भगवान्ने इस अध्यायमें आसुरी-सम्पदाके तीन फल बताये हैं, जिनमेंसे इस श्लोकमें 'निबन्धायासुरी मता' पदोंसे बन्धनरूप सामान्य फल बताया है। दूसरे अध्यायके इकतालीसवेंसे चौवालीसवें श्लोकोंमें वर्णित और नवें अध्यायके बीसवें-इक्कीसवें श्लोकोंमें वर्णित सकाम उपासक भी इसीमें आ जाते हैं। जिनका उद्देश्य केवल भोग भोगना और संग्रह करना है, ऐसे मनुष्योंकी बहुत शाखाओंवाली अनन्त बुद्धियाँ होती हैं अर्थात् उनकी कामनाओंका कोई अन्त नहीं होता। जो कामनाओंमें तन्मय हैं और कर्मफलके प्रशंसक वेदवाक्योंमें ही प्रीति रखते हैं, वे वैदिक यज्ञादिको विधिविधानसे करते हैं, पर कामनाओंके कारण उनको जन्म-मरणरूप बन्धन होता है (गीता 2। 41 -- 44)। ऐसे ही जो यहाँके भोगोंको न चाहकर स्वर्गके दिव्य भोगोंकी कामनासे शास्त्रविहित यज्ञ करते हैं, वे यज्ञके फलस्वरूप (स्वर्गके प्रतिबन्धक पाप नष्ट होनेसे) स्वर्गमें जाकर दिव्य भोग भोगते हैं। जब उनके (स्वर्ग देनेवाले) पुण्य क्षीण हो जाते हैं, तब वे वहाँसे लौटकर आवागमनको प्राप्त हो जाते हैं (गीता 9। 20 -- 21)। अब यहाँ शङ्का यह होती है कि जिस कृष्णमार्ग (गीता 8। 25) से उपर्युक्त सकाम पुरुष जाते हैं, उसी मार्गसे योगभ्रष्ट पुरुष (गीता 6। 41) भी जाते हैं; अतः दोनोंका मार्ग एक होनेसे और दोनों पुनरावर्ती होनेसे सकाम पुरुषोंके समान योगभ्रष्ट पुरुषोंको भी 'निबन्धायासुरी मता' वाला बन्धन होना चाहिये। इसका समाधान यह है कि योगभ्रष्टोंको यह बन्धन नहीं होता। कारण कि पूर्व-(मनुष्यजन्ममें की हुई) साधनामें उनका उद्देश्य अपने कल्याणका रहा है और अन्त समयमें वासना, बेहोशी, पीड़ा आदिके कारण उनको विघ्नरूपसे स्वर्गादिमें जाना पड़ता है। अतः इन योगभ्रष्टोंके इस मार्गसे जानेके कारण ही (गीता 8। 25 में) सकाम पुरुषोंके लिये भी 'योगी' पद आया है, अन्यथा सकाम पुरुष योगी कहे ही नहीं जा सकते। आसुरी-सम्पत्तिका दूसरा फल है -- 'पतन्ति नरकेऽशुचौ' (गीता 16। 16)। जो कामनाके वशीभूत होकर पाप, अन्याय, दुराचार आदि करते हैं, उनको फलस्वरूप स्थानविशेष नरकोंकी प्राप्ति होती है। आसुरी-सम्पत्तिका तीसरा फल है -- 'आसुरीष्वेव योनिषु', 'ततो यान्त्यधमां गतिम्' (गीता 16। 19 -- 20)। जिनके भीतर दुर्गुण-दुर्भाव रहते हैं और कभी-कभी उनसे प्रेरित होकर वे दुराचार भी कर बैठते हैं, उनको दुर्गुण-दुर्भावके अनुसार पहले तो आसुरी योनिकी प्राप्ति और फिर दुराचारके अनुसार अधम गति-(नरकों) की प्राप्ति बतायी गयी है। 'मा शुचः सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातोऽसि पाण्डव' -- केवल अविनाशी परमात्माको चाहनेवालेकी दैवी-सम्पत्ति होती है, जिससे मुक्ति होती है और विनाशी संसारके भोग तथा संग्रहको चाहनेवालेकी आसुरी-सम्पत्ति होती है, जिससे बन्धन होता है -- इस बातको सुनकर अर्जुनके मनमें कहीं यह शङ्का पैदा न हो जाय कि मुझे तो अपनेमें दैवी-सम्पत्ति दीखती ही नहीं! इसलिये भगवान् कहते हैं कि 'भैया अर्जुन! तुम दैवी-सम्पत्तिको प्राप्त हुए हो; अतः शोकसंदेह मत करो। दैवीसम्पत्तिको प्राप्त हो जानेपर साधकके द्वारा कर्मयोग, ज्ञानयोग या भक्तियोगका साधन स्वाभाविक ही होता है। कर्तव्यपालनसे कर्मयोगीके और ज्ञानाग्निसे ज्ञानयोगीके सभी पाप नष्ट हो जाते हैं (गीता 4। 23, 37); परंतु भक्तियोगीके सभी पाप भगवान् नष्ट करते हैं (गीता 18। 66) और संसारसे उसका उद्धार करते हैं (गीता 12। 7)। 'मा शुचः' (टिप्पणी प0 806)--तीसरे श्लोकमें 'भारत' चौथे श्लोकमें 'पार्थ' और इस पाँचवें श्लोकमें 'पाण्डव'--इन तीन सम्बोधनोंका प्रयोग करके भगवान् अर्जुनको उत्साह दिलाते हैं कि 'भारत! तुम्हारा वंश बड़ा श्रेष्ठ है; पार्थ तुम उस माता(पृथा) के पुत्र हो? जो वैरभाव रखनेवालोंकी भी सेवा करनेवाली है पाण्डव तुम बड़े धर्मात्मा और श्रेष्ठ पिता(पाण्डु) के पुत्र हो। तात्पर्य है कि वंश? माता और पिता -- इन तीनों ही दृष्टियोंसे तुम श्रेष्ठ हो अतः तुम्हारेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति भी स्वाभाविक है। इसलिये तुम्हें शोक नहीं करना चाहिये। गीतामें दो बार 'मा शुचः' पद आये हैं -- एक यहाँ और दूसरा अठारहवें अध्यायके छाछठवें श्लोकमें। इन पदोंका दो बार प्रयोग करके भगवान् अर्जुनको समझाते हैं कि तुझे साधन और सिद्धि -- दोनोंके ही विषयमें चिन्ता नहीं करनी चाहिये। साधनके विषयमें यहाँ यह आश्वासन दिया कि तू दैवीसम्पत्तिको प्राप्त हुआ है और सिद्धिके विषय (18। 66) में यह आश्वासन दिया कि मैं तुझे सम्पूर्ण पापोंसे मुक्त कर दूँगा। तात्पर्य यह है कि साधकको अपने साधनमें जो कमियाँ दीखती हैं? उनको तो वह दूर करता रहता है? पर कमियोंके कारण उसके अन्तःकरणमें नम्रताके साथ एक निराशासी रहती है कि मेरेमें अच्छे गुण कहाँ हैं? जिससे साध्यकी प्राप्ति हो साधककी इस निराशाको दूर करनेके लिय भगवान् अर्जुनको साधकमात्रका प्रतिनिधि बनाकर उसे यह आश्वासन देते हैं कि तुम साधन और साध्यके विषयमें चिन्ताशोक मत करो? निराश मत होओ। दैवीसम्पत्तिवाले पुरुषोंका यह स्वभाव होता है कि उनके सामने अनुकूल या प्रतिकूल कोई भी परिस्थिति? घटना आये? उनकी दृष्टि हमेशा अपने कल्याणकी तरफ ही रहती है। युद्धके मौकेपर जब भगवान्ने अर्जुनका रथ दोनों सेनाओंके बीचमें खड़ा किया? तब उन सेनाओंमें खड़े अपने कुटुम्बियोंको देखकर अर्जुनमें कौटुम्बिक स्नेहरूपी मोह पैदा हो गया और वे करुणा तथा शोकसे व्याकुल होकर युद्धरूप कर्तव्यसे हटने लगे। उन्हें विचार हुआ कि युद्धमें कुटुम्बियोंको मारनेसे मुझे पाप ही लगेगा? जिससे मेरे कल्याणमें बाधा लगेगी। इन्हें मारनेसे हमें नाशवान् राज्य और सुखकी प्राप्ति तो हो जायगी? पर उससे श्रेय(कल्याण) की प्राप्ति रुक जायगी। इस प्रकार अर्जुनमें कुटुम्बका मोह और पाप(अन्याय? अधर्म) का भय -- दोनों एक साथ आ जाते हैं। उनमें जो कुटुम्बका मोह है? वह आसुरीसम्पत्ति है और पापके कारण अपने कल्याणमें बाधा लग जानेका जो भय है? वह दैवीसम्पत्ति है। इसमें भी एक खास बात है। अर्जुन कहते हैं कि हमने जो युद्ध करनेका निश्चय कर लिया है? यह भी एक महान् पाप है -- 'अहो बत महत्पापं कर्तुं व्यवसिता वयम्' (1। 45)। वे युद्धक्षेत्रमें भी भगवान्से बारबार अपने कल्याणकी बात पूछते हैं -- 'यच्छ्रेयः स्यान्निश्चितं ब्रूहि तन्मे' (2। 7) 'तदेंक वद निश्चित्य येन श्रेयोऽहमाप्नुयाम्' (3। 2) 'यच्छ्रेय एतयोरेकं तन्मे ब्रूहि सुनिश्चितम्' (5। 1)। यह उनमें दैवीसम्पत्ति होनेके कारण ही है। इसके विपरीत जिनमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति है? ऐसे दुर्योधन आदिमें राज्य और धनका इतना लोभ है कि वे कुटुम्बके नाशसे होनेवाले पापकी तरफ देखते ही नहीं (1। 38)। इस प्रकार अर्जुनमें दैवीसम्पत्ति आरम्भसे ही थी। मोहरूप आसुरीसम्पत्ति तो उनमें आगन्तुक रूपसे आयी थी? जो आगे चलकर भगवान्की कृपासे नष्ट हो गयी -- 'नष्टो मोहः स्मृतिर्लब्धा त्वत्प्रसादान्मयाच्युत' (18। 73)। इसीलिये यहाँ भगवान् कहते हैं कि भैया अर्जुन तू चिन्ता मत कर क्योंकि तू दैवीसम्पत्तिको प्राप्त है। अर्जुनको अपनेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति नहीं दीखती? इसलिये भगवान् अर्जुनसे कहते हैं कि तुम्हारेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति प्रकट है। कारण कि जो श्रेष्ठ पुरुष होते हैं? उनको अपनेमें अच्छे गुण नहीं दीखते और अवगुण उनमें रहते नहीं। अपनेमें गुण न दीखनेका कारण यह है कि उनकी गुणोंके साथ अभिन्नता होती है। जैसे आँखमें लगा हुआ अंजन आँखको नहीं दीखता क्योंकि वह आँखके साथ एक हो जाता है? ऐसे ही दैवीसम्पत्तिके साथ अभिन्नता होनेपर गुण नहीं दीखते। जबतक अपनेमें गुण दीखते हैं? तबतक गुणोंके साथ एकता नहीं हुई है। गुण तभी दीखते हैं? जब वे अपनेसे कुछ दूर होते हैं। अतः भगवान् अर्जुनको आश्वासन देते हैं कि तुम्हारेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वाभाविक है? भले ही वह तुम्हें न दीखे इसलिये तुम चिन्ता मत करो। मार्मिक बात भगवान्ने कृपा करके मानवशरीर दिया है? तो उसकी सफलताके लिये अपने भावों और आचरणोंका विशेष ध्यान रखना चाहिये। कारण कि शरीरका कुछ पता नहीं कि कब प्राण चले जायँ। ऐसी अवस्थामें जल्दीसेजल्दी अपना उद्धार करनेके लिये दैवीसम्पत्तिका आश्रय और आसुरीसम्पत्तिका त्याग करना बहुत आवश्यक है। दैवीसम्पत्तिमें देव शब्द परमात्माका वाचक है और उनकी सम्पत्ति दैवीसम्पत्ति कहलाती है --,'देवस्येयं दैवी।' परमात्माका ही अंश होनेसे जीवमें दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतःस्वाभाविक है। जब जीव अपने अंशी परमात्मासे विमुख होकर जड प्रकृतिके सम्मुख हो जाता है अर्थात् उत्पत्तिविनाशशील शरीरादि पदार्थोंका सङ्ग (तादात्म्य) कर लेता है? तब उसमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति आ जाती है। कारण कि काम? क्रोध? लोभ? मोह? दम्भ? द्वेष आदि जितने भी दुर्गुणदुराचार हैं? वे सबकेसब नाशवान्के सङ्गसे ही पैदा होते हैं। जो प्राणोंको बनाये रखना चाहते हैं? प्राणोंमें ही जिनकी रति है? ऐसे प्राणपोषणपरायण लोगोंका वाचक 'असुर' शब्द है -- 'असुषु प्राणेषु रमन्ते इति असुराः।' इसलिये मैं सुखपूर्वक जीता रहूँ -- यह इच्छा आसुरीसम्पत्तिका खास लक्षण है। दैवी और आसुरीसम्पत्ति सब प्राणियोंमें पायी जाती है (गीता 16। 6)। ऐसा कोई भी साधारण प्राणी नहीं है? जिसमें ये दोनों सम्पत्तियाँ न पायी जाती हों। हाँ? इसमें जीवन्मुक्त? तत्त्वज्ञ महापुरुष तो आसुरीसम्पत्तिसे सर्वथा रहित हो जाते हैं (टिप्पणी प0 807)? पर दैवीसम्पत्तिसे रहित कभी कोई हो ही नहीं सकता। कारण कि जीव देव अर्थात् परमात्माका सनातन अंश है। परमात्माका अंश होनेसे इसमें दैवीसम्पत्ति रहती ही है। आसुरीसम्पत्तिकी मुख्यता होनेसे दैवीसम्पत्ति दबसी जाती है? मिटती नहीं क्योंकि सत्वस्तु कभी मिट नहीं सकती। इसलिये कोई भी मनुष्य सर्वथा दुर्गुणीदुराचारी नहीं हो सकता? सर्वथा निर्दयी नहीं हो सकता? सर्वथा असत्यवादी नहीं हो सकता? सर्वथा व्यभिचारी नहीं हो सकता। जितने भी दुर्गुणदुराचार हैं? वे किसी भी व्यक्तिमें सर्वथा हो ही नहीं सकते। कोई भी? कभी भी? कितना ही दुर्गुणीदुराचारी क्यों न हो? उसके साथ आंशिक सद्गुणसदाचार रहेंगे ही। दैवीसम्पत्ति प्रकट होनेपर आसुरीसम्पत्ति मिट जाती है क्योंकि दैवीसम्पत्ति परमात्माकी होनेसे अविनाशी है और आसुरीसम्पत्ति संसारकी होनेसे नाशवान् है। सच्चिदानन्दस्वरूप परमात्माका अंश होनेसे मैं सदा जीता रहूँ अर्थात् कभी मरूँ नहीं मैं सब कुछ जान लूँ अर्थात् कभी अज्ञानी न रहूँ मैं सर्वदा सुखी रहूँ अर्थात् कभी दुःखी न होऊँ -- इस तरह सत्चित्आनन्दकी इच्छा प्राणिमात्रमें रहती है। पर उससे गलती यह होती है कि मैं रहूँ तो शरीरसहित रहूँ मैं जानकर बनूँ तो बुद्धिको लेकर जानकार बनूँ मैं सुख लूँ तो इन्द्रियों और शरीरको लेकर सुख लूँ -- इस तरह इन इच्छाओंको नाशवान् संसारसे ही पूरी करना चाहता है। इस प्रकार प्राणोंका मोह होनेसे आसुरीसम्पत्ति रहती ही है (टिप्पणी प0 808)। इसमें एक मार्मिक बात है कि प्राणीमें नित्यनिरन्तर रहनेकी इच्छा होती है? तो यह नित्यनिरन्तर रह सकता है और मैं मरूँ नहीं? यह इच्छा होती है? तो यह,मरता नहीं। जीता रहना अच्छा लगता है? तो जीते रहना इसका स्वाभाविक है और मरनेसे भय लगता है? तो मरना इसका स्वाभाविक नहीं है। ऐसे ही अज्ञान बुरा लगता है? तो अज्ञान इसका साथी नहीं है। दुःख बुरा लगता है? तो दुःख इसका साथी नहीं है। इससे सिद्ध होता है कि इसका स्वरूप सत् है। असत् इसका स्वरूप नहीं है। सत्स्वरूप होकर भी यह सत्को यह क्यों चाहता है कारण कि इसने नष्ट होनेवाले असत् शरीरादिको मैं तथा मेरा मान लिया है और उनमें आसक्त हो गया है। तात्पर्य यह कि असत्को स्वीकार करनेसे स्वयं सत् होते हुए भी सत्की इच्छा होती है जडताको स्वीकार करनेसे स्वयं ज्ञानस्वरूप होते हुए भी ज्ञानकी इच्छा होती है दुःखरूप संसारको स्वीकार करनेसे स्वयं सुखस्वरूप होते हुए भी सुखकी इच्छा होती है। पर उसकी पूर्ति भी असत्जडदुःखरूप संसारके द्वारा ही करना चाहता है। तादात्म्यके कारण यह शरीरको ही रखना चाहता है? बुद्धिसे ही ज्ञानी बनना चाहता है? शरीरसे ही श्रेष्ठ और सुखी बनना चाहता है? अपने नाम और रूपको ही स्थायी रखना चाहता है। अपने नामको तो मरनेके बाद भी स्थायी रखना चाहता है? इस प्रकार असत्के सङ्गसे आसुरीसम्पत्ति आती है। ऐसे ही असत्के सङ्गका त्याग करनेसे आसुरीसम्पत्ति नष्ट हो जाती है और दैवीसम्पत्ति प्रकट हो जाती है। जब सत्सङ्ग? स्वाध्याय आदिके द्वारा मनुष्यमें परमात्मप्राप्ति करनेका विचार होता है? तब वह इसके लिये दैवीसम्पत्तिको धारण करना चाहता है। दैवीसम्पत्तिको वह कर्तव्यरूपसे उपार्जित करता है कि मुझे सत्य बोलना है? मुझे अहिंसक बनना है? मुझे दयालु बनना है? आदिआदि। इस प्रकार जितने भी दैवीसम्पत्तिके गुण हैं? उन गुणोंको वह अपने बलसे उपार्जित करना चाहता है। यह सिद्धान्त है कि कर्तव्यरूपसे प्राप्त की हुई और अपने बल(पुरुषार्थ) से उपार्जित की हुई चीज स्वाभाविक नहीं होती? प्रत्युत कृत्रिम होती है। इसके अलावा अपने पुरुषार्थसे उपार्जित माननेके कारण अभिमान आता है कि मैं बड़ा सत्यभाषी हूँ? मैं बड़ा अच्छा आदमी हूँ? आदि। जितने भी दुर्गुणदुराचार हैं? सबकेसब अभिमानकी छायामें रहते हैं और अभिमानसे ही पुष्ट होते हैं। इसलिये अपने उद्योगसे किया हुआ जितना भी साधन होता है? उस साधनमें अहंकार ज्योंकात्यों रहता है और अहंकारमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति रहती है। अतः जबतक वह दैवीसम्पत्तिके लिये उद्योग करता रहता है? तबतक आसुरीसम्पत्ति छूटती नहीं। अन्तमें वह हार मान लेता है अथवा उसका उत्साह कम हो जाता है? उसका प्रयत्न मंद हो जाता है और मान लेता है कि यह मेरे वशकी बात नहीं है। साधककी ऐसी दशा क्यों होती है कारण कि उसने अभीतक यह जाना नहीं कि आसुरीसम्पत्ति मेरेमें कैसे आयी आसुरीसम्पत्तिका कारण है -- नाशवान्का सङ्ग। इसका सङ्ग जबतक रहेगा? तबतक आसुरीसम्पत्ति रहेगी ही। वह नाशवान्के सङ्गको नहीं छोड़ता? तो आसुरीसम्पत्ति उसे नहीं छोड़ती अर्थात् आसुरीसम्पत्ति से वह सर्वथा रहित नहीं हो सकता। इसलिये यदि वह दैवीसम्पत्तिको लाना चाहे? तो नाशवान् जडके सङ्गका त्याग कर दे। नाशवान्के सङ्गका त्याग करनेपर दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतः प्रकट होगी क्योंकि परमात्माका अंश होनेसे परमात्माकी सम्पत्ति उसमें स्वतःसिद्ध है? कर्तव्यरूपसे उपार्जित नहीं करनी है। इसमें एक और मार्मिक बात है। दैवीसम्पत्तिके गुण स्वतःस्वाभाविक रहते हैं। इन्हें कोई छोड़ नहीं सकता। इसका पता कैसे लगे जैसे कोई विचार करे कि मैं सत्य ही बोलूँगा तो वह उम्रभर सत्य बोल सकता है। परन्तु कोई विचार करे कि मैं झूठ ही बोलूँगा? तो वह आठ पहर भी झूठ नहीं बोल सकता। सत्य ही बोलनेका विचार होनेपर वह दुःख भोग सकता है? पर झूठ बोलनेके लिये बाध्य नहीं हो सकता। परन्तु झूठ ही बोलूँगा -- ऐसा विचार होनेपर तो खानापीना? बोलनाचलना तक उसके लिये मुश्किल हो जायगा। भूख लगी हो और झूठ बोले कि भूख नहीं है? तो जीना मुश्किल हो जायगा। यदि वह ऐसी प्रतिज्ञा कर ले कि झूठ बोलनेसे बेशक मर जाऊँ? पर झूठ ही बोलूँगा? तो यह प्रतिज्ञा सत्य हो जायगी। अतः या तो प्रतिज्ञाभङ्ग होनेसे सत्य आ जायगा या प्रतिज्ञा सत्य हो जायगी। सत्य कभी छूटेगा नहीं क्योंकि सत्य मनुष्यमात्रमें स्वाभाविक है। इस तरह दैवीसम्पत्तिके जितने भी गुण हैं? सबके विषयमें ऐसी ही बात है। वे तो नित्य रहनेवाले और स्वाभाविक हैं। केवल नाशवान्के सङ्गका त्याग करना है। नाशवान्का सङ्ग अनित्य और अस्वाभाविक है। आसुरीसम्पत्ति आगन्तुक है। दुर्गुणदुराचार बिलकुल ही आगन्तुक हैं। कोई आदमी प्रसन्न रहता है? तो लोग ऐसा नहीं कहते कि तुम प्रसन्न क्यों रहते हो पर कोई आदमी दुःखी रहता है? तब कहते हैं कि दुःखी क्यों रहते हो क्योंकि प्रसन्नता स्वाभाविक है और दुःख अस्वाभाविक (आगन्तुक) है। इसलिये अच्छे आचरण करनेवालेको कोई नहीं कहता कि तुम अच्छे आचरण क्यों करते हो पर बुरे आचरणवालेको सब कहते हैं कि तुम बुरे आचरण क्यों करते हो अतः सद्गुणसदाचार स्वतः रहते हैं और दुर्गुणदुराचार सङ्गसे आते हैं? इसलिये आगन्तक हैं। अर्जुनमें दैवीसम्पत्ति विशेषतासे थी। जब उनमें कायरता आ गयी? तब भगवान्ने आश्चर्यसे कहा कि तेरेमें यह कायरता कहाँसे आ गयी (2। 2 -- 3) तात्पर्य यह है कि अर्जुनमें यह दोष स्वाभाविक नहीं? आगन्तुक है। पहले उनमें यह दोष था नहीं। अर्जुन आगे कहते हैं कि जिससे मेरा निश्चित कल्याण हो? ऐसी बात कहिये (2। 7 3। 2 5। 1)। युद्धके प्रसङ्गमें भी अर्जुनमें मेरा कल्याण हो जाय यह इच्छा है। तो इससे प्रतीत होता है कि अर्जुनके स्वभावमें पहलेसे ही दैवीसम्पत्ति थी? नहीं तो उर्वशीजैसी अप्सराको एकदम ठुकरा देना कोई मामूली आदमीकी बात नहीं थी। वे अर्जुन विचार करते हैं कि मेरेको दैवीसम्पत्ति प्राप्त है कि नहीं मैं उसका अधिकारी हूँ कि नहीं अतः उसे आश्वासन देते हुए भगवान् कहते हैं कि तू शोक मत कर तू दैवीसम्पत्तिको प्राप्त है -- 'मा शुचः सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातोऽसि पाण्डव' (16। 5)। सत् (चेतन) और असत्(जड) के तादात्म्यसे अहम्भाव पैदा होता है। मनुष्य शुभ या अशुभ? कोई भी काम करता है? तो अपने अहंकारको लेकर करता है। जब वह परमात्माकी तरफ चलता है? तब उसके अहंभावमें सत्अंशकी मुख्यता होती है और जब संसारकी तरफ चलता है? तब उसके अहंभावमें नाशवान् असत्अंशकी मुख्यता होती है। सत्अंशकी मुख्यता होनेसे वह दैवीसम्पत्तिका अधिकारी कहा जाता है और असत्अंशकी मुख्यता होनेसे वह उसका अनधिकारी कहा जाता है। असत्अंशको मिटानेके लिये ही मानवशरीर मिला है। अतः मनुष्य निर्बल नहीं है? पराधीन नहीं है? प्रत्युत यह सर्वथा सबल है? स्वाधीन है। नाशवान्? असत्अंश तो सबका मिटता ही रहता है? पर वह उससे अपना सम्बन्ध बनाये रखता है। यह भूल होती है। नाशवान्से सम्बन्ध बनाये रखनेके कारण आसुरीसम्पत्तिका सर्वथा अभाव नहीं होता। अहंभाव नाशवान्? असत्के सम्बन्धसे ही होता है। असत्का सम्बन्ध मिटते ही अहंभाव मिट जाता है। प्रकृतिके अंशको पकड़नेसे ही अहंभाव है। अहम्में जडचेतन दोनों हैं। तादात्म्य होनेसे पुरुष(चेतन) ने जडके साथ अपनेको एक मान लिया। भोगपदार्थोंकी सब इच्छाएँ असत्अंशमें ही रहती हैं। परन्तु सुखदुःखके भोक्तापनमें पुरुष हेतु बनता है -- 'पुरुषः सुखदुःखानां भोक्तृत्वे हेतुरुच्यते' (13। 20)। वास्तवमें हेतु है नहीं क्योंकि वह प्रकृतिस्थ होनेसे ही भोक्ता बनता है -- 'पुरुषः प्रकृतिस्थो हि भुङ्क्ते' (13। 21)। अतः सुखदुःखरूप जो विकार होता है? वह मुख्यताके जडअंशमें ही होता है। परन्तु तादात्म्य होनेसे उसका परिणाम ज्ञाता चेतनपर होता है कि मैं सुखी हूँ? मैं दुःखी हूँ। जैसे विवाह होनेपर स्त्रीकी जो आवश्यकता होती है? वह अपनी आवश्यकता कहलाती है। पुरुष जो गहने आदि खरीदता है? वह स्त्रीके सम्बन्धसे ही (स्त्रीके लिये) खरीदता है? नहीं तो उसे अपने लिये गहने आदिकी आवश्यकता नहीं है। ऐसे ही जडअंशके सम्बन्धसे ही चेतनमें जडकी इच्छा और जडका भोग होता है। जडका भोग जडअंशमें ही होता है? पर जडसे तादात्म्य होनेसे भोगका परिणाम केवल जडमें नहीं हो सकता अर्थात् सुखदुःखका भोक्ता केवल जडअंश नहीं बन सकता। परिणामका ज्ञाता चेतन ही भोक्ता बनता है। जितनी क्रियाएँ होती हैं? सब प्रकृतिमें होती हैं (3। 27 13। 29)? पर तादात्म्यके कारण चेतन उन्हें अपनेमें मान लेता है कि मैं कर्ता हूँ। तादात्म्यमें चेतन (परमात्मा) की इच्छामें चेतनकी मुख्यता और जड(संसार) की इच्छामें जडकी मुख्यता रहती है। जब चेतनकी मुख्यता रहती है? तब दैवीसम्पत्ति आती है और जब जडकी मुख्यता रहती है? तब आसुरीसम्पत्ति आती है। जडसे तादात्म्य रहनेपर भी सत्? चित् और आनन्दकी इच्छा चेतनमें ही रहती है। संसारकी ऐसी कोई इच्छा नहीं है? जो इन तीन (सदा रहना? सब कुछ जानना और सदा सुखी रहना),इच्छाओंमें सम्मिलित न हो। इससे गलती यह होती है कि इन इच्छाओंकी पूर्ति जड(संसार) के द्वारा करना चाहता है। जडको और आसुरीसम्पत्तिको स्वयं(चेतन) ने स्वीकार किया है। जडमें यह ताकत नहीं है कि वह स्वयंके साथ स्थिर रह जाय। जडमें तो हरदम परिवर्तन होता रहता है। चेतन उसको न पकड़े? तो वह अपनेआप छूट जायगा। कारण कि चेतनमें कभी विकार नहीं होता। वह सदा ज्योंकात्यों रहता है। पर असत् प्रकृति नित्यनिरन्तर? हरदम बदलती रहती है। वह कभी एकरूप रह ही नहीं सकती। चेतनने प्रकृतिके साथ सम्बन्ध स्वीकार कर लिया। उस सम्बन्धकी सत्ता यह मैं और मेरेरूपसे स्वीकार कर लेता है। अतः जडका सम्बन्ध और उससे पैदा होनेवाली आसुरीसम्पत्ति आगन्तुक है। यदि यह स्वयंमें होती? तो इसका कभी नाश नहीं होता क्योंकि स्वयंका कभी नाश नहीं होता और आसुरीसम्पत्तिके त्यागकी बात ही नहीं होती। अनित्य होनेपर भी चेतनके सम्बन्धसे यह नित्य दीखने लगती है। अविनाशीके सम्बन्धसे विनाशी भी अविनाशीकी तरह दीखने लगता है। इसलिये जिस मनुष्यमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति होती है? वह आसुरीसम्पत्तिका त्याग कर सकता है? और कल्याणका आचरण करके परमात्माको प्राप्त हो सकता है (16। 22)।परमात्माके सम्मुख होते ही आसुरीसम्पत्ति मिटने लगती है -- 'सनमुख होइ जीव मोहि जबहीं'। जन्म कोटि अघ नासहिं तबहीं।।(मानस 5। 44। 1) कारण कि जन्म कोटि अघ प्रकृतिसे सम्बन्ध स्वीकार करनेसे ही हुए हैं। प्रकृतिको स्वीकार न करें? तो फिर कैसे जन्ममरण होगा जन्ममरणमें कारण प्रकृतिसे सम्बन्ध ही है -- 'कारणं गुणसङ्गोऽस्य सदसद्योनिजन्मसु' (गीता 13। 21)। परन्तु जीवात्मा प्रकृतिकी क्रियाको अपनेमें मान लेता है? और प्रकृतिके कार्य शरीरमें मैंमेरापन कर लेता है? जिससे जन्मतामरता रहता है। वास्तवमें यह कर्ता भी नहीं है और लिप्त भी नहीं है -- 'शरीरस्थोऽपि कौन्तये न करोति न लिप्यते' (13। 31)। इस वास्तविकताका अनुभव करना ही कर्ममें अकर्म तथा अकर्ममें कर्म देखना है। इन दोनों बातोंका अभिप्राय यह है कि कर्म करते हुए भी यह सर्वथा निर्लिप्त तथा अकर्ता है और निर्लिप्त तथा अकर्ता रहते हुए ही यह कर्म करता है अर्थात् कर्म करते समय और कर्म न करते समय यह (आत्मा) नित्यनिरन्तर निर्लिप्त तथा अकर्ता रहता है। इस वास्तविकताका अनुभव करनेवाला ही मनुष्योंमें बुद्धिमान् है (4। 18)। जिसमें कर्तापनका भाव नहीं है और जिसकी बुद्धिमें लिप्तता नहीं है अर्थात् कोई भी कामना नहीं है? वह यदि सब प्राणियोंको मार दे? तो भी पाप नहीं लगता ( 18। 17)। अर्जुनने पूछा कि मनुष्य किससे प्रेरित होकर पाप करता है तो भगवान्ने कहा -- कामनासे (3। 36 -- 37)। कामनाके कारण ही सब पाप होते हैं। शरीरके तादात्म्यसे भोग और संग्रहकी कामना होती है (टिप्पणी प0 810)। अतः जडका सङ्ग (महत्त्व) ही सम्पूर्ण पापोंका -- आसुरीसम्पत्तिका कारण है। जडका सङ्ग न हो? तो दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतःसिद्ध है। अर्जुन साधकमात्रके प्रतिनिधि हैं। इसलिये अर्जुनके निमित्तसे भगवान् साधकमात्रको आश्वासन देते हैं कि चिन्ता मत करो अपनेमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति दीख जाय? तो घबराओ मत क्योंकि तुम्हारेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतःस्वाभाविक विद्यमान है -- 'मा शुचः सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातोऽसि पाण्डव'।।(16। 5) तात्पर्य यह हुआ कि साधकको पारमार्थिक उन्नतिसे कभी निराश नहीं होना चाहिये क्योंकि परमात्माका ही,अंश होनेसे मनुष्यमात्रमें परमात्माकी सम्पत्ति (दैवीसम्पत्ति) रहती ही है। परमात्मप्राप्तिका ही उद्देश्य होनेसे दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतः प्रकट हो जाती है। परमात्माका अंश होनेके नाते साधकको परमात्मप्राप्तिसे कभी निराश नहीं होना चाहिये क्योंकि परमात्माने कृपा करके मनुष्यशरीर अपनी प्राप्तिके लिये ही दिया है। इसलिये परमात्माका संकल्प तो हमारे कल्याणका ही है। यदि हम अपना अलग कोई संकल्प न रखें? प्रत्युत परमात्माके संकल्पमें ही अपना संकल्प मिला दें? तो फिर उनकी कृपासे स्वतः कल्याण हो ही जाता है। सम्बन्ध--सम्पूर्ण प्राणियोंमें चेतन और जड -- दोनों अंश रहते हैं। उनमेंसे कई प्राणियोंका जडतासे विमुख होकर चेतन(परमात्मा) की ओर मुख्यतासे लक्ष्य रहता है और कई प्राणियोंका चेतनसे विमुख होकर जडता(भोग और संग्रह) की ओर मुख्यतासे लक्ष्य रहता है। इस प्रकार चेतन और जडकी मुख्यताको लेकर प्राणियोंके दो भेद हो जाते हैं? जिनको भगवान् आगेके श्लोकमें बताते हैं।",

            "Hindi": "दैवी और आसुरी गुणों की इतनी विस्तृत सूचियों को श्रवण कर कोई भी लगनशील साधक जानना चाहेगा कि वह किस सम्पदा से सम्पन्न है। प्राय साधकगण अपने अवगुणों के प्रति अधिक जागरूक होते हैं और इस कारण उन्हें स्वयं में दैवी गुणों की सम्पन्नता में पूर्ण विश्वास नहीं हो पाता। सम्भवत? इसी प्रकार की निराशा के भाव अर्जुन के मुख पर देखकर भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण उसे तत्काल सांत्वना देते हुए कहते हैं? हे पाण्डव तुम शोक मत करो? तुम दैवी गुणों के साथ जन्मे हो। यदि कोई विद्यार्थी रुचि और अध्यवसाय के साथ अध्ययन करते हुए गीता के इस अध्याय तक पहुँच जाता है? तो यही इस तथ्य का प्रमाण है कि वह दैवी सम्पदा से सम्पन्न है यहाँ सदाचार की सुन्दरता और दुराचार की कुरूपता का वर्णन करने का प्रय़ोजन सत्पुरुषों को नित्य स्वर्ग का और असत्पुरुषों को नित्य नारकीय यातनाओं का भोग करने हेतु भेजने का नहीं है यहाँ? विषय वस्तु के विवेचन का वैज्ञानिक आधार है। नैतिक गुणों का पालन करना मनुष्य की क्षीण शक्तियों और कलान्त प्रेरणाओं को पुनर्जीवित करने का बुद्धिमत्तापूर्ण साधन है। इन गुणों को अपने जीवन में जीने से? मनुष्य स्वनिर्मित संकल्पों के बन्धनों से मुक्त हो जाता है दैवी सम्पदा मोक्ष का साधन है। इसके विपरीत? पापी पुरुषों के द्वारा अनुचरित दुष्प्रवृत्तियाँ मनुष्य को भ्रान्ति और दुख के साथ बांध कर रखती हैं और उसे अपने आन्त्ारिक व्यक्तित्व के विकास से वंचित रखती हैं आसुरी सम्पदा बन्धन का कारण है।तुम शोक मत करो कभीकभी साधकगण अत्यधिक भावुक बनकर निराश हो जाते हैं। तब उनकी प्रवृत्ति अपनी ही आलोचना करने की ओर हो जाती है। परिणामस्वरूप वे विषाद और अवसाद को प्राप्त होते हैं? जो कि एक प्रकार का मानसिक रोग है। ऐसा पुरुष कभी भी स्वयं में शक्तिवर्धक प्रसन्नता? आत्मविश्वास और दृढ़ संकल्प को नहीं पाता है जो कि आत्मनिरीक्षण और आत्मोपचार के लिए आवश्यक होते हैं। सदाचार का जीवन अपने आप में ही इस प्रकार के कुछ रोगों का उपचार कर देता है। हिन्दुओं की दृष्टि में? पापी पुरुष कोई मानसिक रूप से कुष्ठ रोगी नहीं है और न ही वह सर्वशक्तिमान् ईश्वर की विफलता का द्योतक है। वेदान्ती लोग असुर या राक्षस को ईश्वर के लिए नित्य चुनौती के रूप में नहीं देखते हैं।दुर्बलता और अज्ञान से युक्त शुभ ही अशुभ कहलाता है और इन दोषों से मुक्त अशुभ ही शुभ बन जाता है। धूलि से आच्छादित दर्पण अपने समक्ष स्थित वस्तु को प्रतिबिम्बित नहीं कर पाता परन्तु इसका कारण दर्पण की अक्षमता न होकर उस पर धूलि का आच्छादन है? जो वस्तुत उससे भिन्न है। दर्पण को स्वच्छ कर देने पर उसमें वस्तु का प्रतिबिम्ब स्पष्ट प्रकाशित होता है। इसी प्रकार? एक दुराचारी पुरुष के हृदय में भी सच्चित्स्वरूप आत्मा का प्रकाश विद्यमान होता है। परन्तु? दुर्भाग्य है कि वह प्रकाश उस पुरुष की अपनी ही मिथ्या धारणाओं एवं असत् मूल्यों के कारण आच्छादित रहता है।अब? असुरों का विशेष अध्ययन करने की दृष्टि से भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण कहते हैं",

            "Devnagri": "दैवी और आसुरी गुणों की इतनी विस्तृत सूचियों को श्रवण कर कोई भी लगनशील साधक जानना चाहेगा कि वह किस सम्पदा से सम्पन्न है। प्राय साधकगण अपने अवगुणों के प्रति अधिक जागरूक होते हैं और इस कारण उन्हें स्वयं में दैवी गुणों की सम्पन्नता में पूर्ण विश्वास नहीं हो पाता। सम्भवत? इसी प्रकार की निराशा के भाव अर्जुन के मुख पर देखकर भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण उसे तत्काल सांत्वना देते हुए कहते हैं? हे पाण्डव तुम शोक मत करो? तुम दैवी गुणों के साथ जन्मे हो। यदि कोई विद्यार्थी रुचि और अध्यवसाय के साथ अध्ययन करते हुए गीता के इस अध्याय तक पहुँच जाता है? तो यही इस तथ्य का प्रमाण है कि वह दैवी सम्पदा से सम्पन्न है यहाँ सदाचार की सुन्दरता और दुराचार की कुरूपता का वर्णन करने का प्रय़ोजन सत्पुरुषों को नित्य स्वर्ग का और असत्पुरुषों को नित्य नारकीय यातनाओं का भोग करने हेतु भेजने का नहीं है यहाँ? विषय वस्तु के विवेचन का वैज्ञानिक आधार है। नैतिक गुणों का पालन करना मनुष्य की क्षीण शक्तियों और कलान्त प्रेरणाओं को पुनर्जीवित करने का बुद्धिमत्तापूर्ण साधन है। इन गुणों को अपने जीवन में जीने से? मनुष्य स्वनिर्मित संकल्पों के बन्धनों से मुक्त हो जाता है दैवी सम्पदा मोक्ष का साधन है। इसके विपरीत? पापी पुरुषों के द्वारा अनुचरित दुष्प्रवृत्तियाँ मनुष्य को भ्रान्ति और दुख के साथ बांध कर रखती हैं और उसे अपने आन्त्ारिक व्यक्तित्व के विकास से वंचित रखती हैं आसुरी सम्पदा बन्धन का कारण है।तुम शोक मत करो कभीकभी साधकगण अत्यधिक भावुक बनकर निराश हो जाते हैं। तब उनकी प्रवृत्ति अपनी ही आलोचना करने की ओर हो जाती है। परिणामस्वरूप वे विषाद और अवसाद को प्राप्त होते हैं? जो कि एक प्रकार का मानसिक रोग है। ऐसा पुरुष कभी भी स्वयं में शक्तिवर्धक प्रसन्नता? आत्मविश्वास और दृढ़ संकल्प को नहीं पाता है जो कि आत्मनिरीक्षण और आत्मोपचार के लिए आवश्यक होते हैं। सदाचार का जीवन अपने आप में ही इस प्रकार के कुछ रोगों का उपचार कर देता है। हिन्दुओं की दृष्टि में? पापी पुरुष कोई मानसिक रूप से कुष्ठ रोगी नहीं है और न ही वह सर्वशक्तिमान् ईश्वर की विफलता का द्योतक है। वेदान्ती लोग असुर या राक्षस को ईश्वर के लिए नित्य चुनौती के रूप में नहीं देखते हैं।दुर्बलता और अज्ञान से युक्त शुभ ही अशुभ कहलाता है और इन दोषों से मुक्त अशुभ ही शुभ बन जाता है। धूलि से आच्छादित दर्पण अपने समक्ष स्थित वस्तु को प्रतिबिम्बित नहीं कर पाता परन्तु इसका कारण दर्पण की अक्षमता न होकर उस पर धूलि का आच्छादन है? जो वस्तुत उससे भिन्न है। दर्पण को स्वच्छ कर देने पर उसमें वस्तु का प्रतिबिम्ब स्पष्ट प्रकाशित होता है। इसी प्रकार? एक दुराचारी पुरुष के हृदय में भी सच्चित्स्वरूप आत्मा का प्रकाश विद्यमान होता है। परन्तु? दुर्भाग्य है कि वह प्रकाश उस पुरुष की अपनी ही मिथ्या धारणाओं एवं असत् मूल्यों के कारण आच्छादित रहता है।अब? असुरों का विशेष अध्ययन करने की दृष्टि से भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण कहते हैं",

The persons themselves, who are created with the natures of gods and demons, are being spoken of as 'two creations of beings', which accords with the Upanisadic text, 'There were two classes of Prajapati's sons, the gods and the demons' (Br. 1.3.1). For, asmin, in this; loke, world, all (persons) can rationally be divided into two classes. Which are those two creations of beings? The answer is, the two are the daiva, divine; eva ca, and; the asura, the demoniacal which are being discussed. The Lord speaks of the need of restating the two that have been already referred to: Daivah, the divine creation of beings; proktah, has been spoken of; vistarasah, elaborately-in, 'Fearlessness, purity of mind,' etc. (1-3). But the demoniacal has not been spoken of in extenso. Hence, O son of Prtha, srnu, hear of, understand; the asuram, demoniacal; me, from Me, from My speech which is being uttered in detail, so that this may be avoided.

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या -- द्वौ भूतसर्गौ लोकेऽस्मिन्दैव आसुर एव च -- आसुरीसम्पत्तिका विस्तारपूर्वक वर्णन करनेके लिये उसका उपक्रम करते हुए भगवान् कहते हैं कि इस लोकमें प्राणिसमुदाय दो तरहका है -- दैव और आसुर। तात्पर्य यह है कि प्राणिमात्रमें परमात्मा और प्रकृति -- दोनोंका अंश है। (गीता 10। 39 18। 40)। परमात्माका अंश चेतन है और प्रकृतिका अंश जड है। वह चेतन अंश जब परिवर्तनशील जडअंशके सम्मुख हो जाता है? तब उसमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति आ जाती है और जब वह जड प्रकृतिसे विमुख होकर केवल परमात्माके सम्मुख हो जाता है? तब उसमें दैवीसम्पत्ति जाग्रत् हो जाती है।देव नाम परमात्माका है। परमात्माकी प्राप्तिके लिये जितने भी सद्गुणसदाचार आदि साधन हैं? वे सब दैवीसम्पदा हैं। जैसे भगवान् नित्य हैं? ऐसे ही उनकी साधनसम्पत्ति भी नित्य है। भगवान्ने परमात्मप्राप्तिके साधनको अव्यय अर्थात् अविनाशी कहा है -- इमं विवस्वते योगं प्रोक्तवानहमव्ययम् (गीता 4। 1)।द्वौ भूतसर्गौ में भूत शब्दसे मनुष्य? देवता? असुर? राक्षस? भूत? प्रेत? पिशाच? पशु? पक्षी? कीट? पतंग? वृक्ष? लता आदि सम्पूर्ण स्थावरजंगम प्राणी लिये जा सकते हैं। परन्तु आसुर स्वभावका त्याग करनेकी विवेकशक्ति मुख्यरूपसे मनुष्यशरीरमें ही है। इसलिये मनुष्यको आसुर स्वभावका सर्वथा त्याग करना चाहिये। उसका त्याग होते ही दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतः प्रकट हो जाती है।मनुष्यमें दैवी और आसुरी -- दोनों सम्पत्तियाँ रहती हैं -- सुमति कुमति सब कें उर रहहीं। नाथ पुरान निगम अस कहहीं।।(मानस 5। 40। 3)क्रूरसेक्रूर कसाईमें भी दया रहती है? चोरसेचोरमें भी साहूकारी रहती है। इसी तरह दैवीसम्पत्तिसे रहित कोई हो ही नहीं सकता क्योंकि जीवमात्र परमात्माका अंश है। उसमें दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतःस्वाभाविक है और आसुरी सम्पत्ति अपनी बनायी हुई है। सच्चे हृदयसे परमात्माकी तरफ चलनेवाले साधकोंको आसुरीसम्पत्ति निरन्तर खटकती है? बुरी लगती है और उसको दूर करनेका वे प्रयत्न भी करते हैं। परन्तु जो लोग भजनस्मरणके साथ आसुरीसम्पत्तिका भी पोषण करते रहते हैं अर्थात् कुछ भजनस्मरण? नित्यकर्म आदि भी कर लेते हैं और सांसारिक भोग तथा संग्रहमें भी सुख लेते हैं और उसे आवश्यक समझते हैं? वे वास्तवमें साधक नहीं कहे जा सकते। कारण कि कुछ दैव स्वभाव और कुछ आसुर स्वभाव तो नीचसेनीच प्राणीमें भी स्वाभाविक रहता है।एक विशेष ध्यान देनेकी बात है कि अहंताके अनुरूप प्रवृत्ति होती है और प्रवृत्तिके अनुसार अहंताकी दृढ़ता होती है। जिसकी अहंतामें मैं सत्यवादी हूँ ऐसा भाव होगा? वह सत्य बोलेगा और सत्य बोलनेसे उसकी सत्यनिष्ठा दृढ़ हो जायगी। फिर वह कभी असत्य नहीं बोल सकेगा। परन्तु जिसकी अहंतामें मैं संसारी हूँ और संसारके भोग भोगना और संग्रह करना मेरा काम है ऐसे भाव होंगे? उसको झूठकपट करते देरी नहीं लगेगी। छूठकपट करनेसे उसकी अहंतामें ये भाव दृढ़ हो जाते हैं कि बिना झूठकपट किये किसीका काम नहीं चल ही नहीं सकता? जिसमें भी आजकलके जमानेमें तो ऐसा करना ही पड़ता है? इससे कोई बच नहीं सकता आदि। इस प्रकार अहंतामें दुर्भाव आनेसे ही दुराचारोंसे छूटना कठिन हो जाता है और इसी कारण लोग दुर्गुणदुराचारको छोड़ना कठिन या असम्भव मानते हैं।परमात्माका अंश होनेसे सद्भावसे रहित कोई नहीं हो सकता और शरीरके साथ अंहताममता रखते हुए दुर्भावसे सर्वथा रहित कोई नहीं हो सकता। दुर्भावोंके आनेपर भी सद्भावका बीज कभी नष्ट नहीं होता क्योंकि सद्भाव सत् है और सत्का कभी अभाव नहीं होता -- नाभावो विद्यते सतः (2। 16)। इसके विपरीत दुर्भाव कुसङ्गसे उत्पन्न होनेवाले हैं और उत्पन्न होनेवाली वस्तु नित्य नहीं होती -- नासतो विद्यते भावः (2। 16)।मनुष्योंकी सद्भाव या दुर्भावकी मुख्यताको लेकर ही प्रवृत्ति होती है। जब सद्भावकी मुख्यता होती है? तब वह सदाचार करता है और जब दुर्भावकी मुख्यता होती है? तब वह दुराचार करता है। तात्पर्य है कि जिसका उद्देश्य परमात्मप्राप्तिका हो जाता है? उसमें सद्भावकी मुख्यता हो जाती है और दुर्भाव मिटने लगते हैं और जिसका उद्देश्य सांसारिक भोग और संग्रहका हो जाता है? उसमें दुर्भावकी मुख्यता हो जाती है और सद्भाव छिपने लगते हैं।लोकेऽस्मिन् का तात्पर्य है कि नयेनये अधिकार पृथ्वीमण्डलमें ही मिलते हैं। पृथ्वीमण्डलमें भी भारतक्षेत्रमें विलक्षण अधिकार प्राप्त होते हैं। भारतभूमिपर जन्म लेनेवाले मनुष्योंकी देवताओंने भी प्रशंसा की है (टिप्पणी प0 812)। कल्याणका मौका मनुष्यलोकमें ही है। इस लोकमें आकर मनुष्यको विशेष सावधानीसे दैवीसम्पत्ति जाग्रत् करनी चाहिये। भगवान्ने विशेष कृपा करके ही यह मनुष्यशरीर दिया है --,कबहुँक करि करुना नर देही। देत ईस बिनु हेतु सनेही।।(मानस 7। 44। 3) ,जिन प्राणियोंको भगवान् मनुष्य बनाते हैं? उनपर भगवान् विश्वास करते हैं कि ये अपना कल्याण (उद्धार) करेंगे। इसी आशासे वे मनुष्यशरीर देते हैं। भगवान्ने विशेष कृपा करके मनुष्यको अपनी प्राप्तिकी सामग्री और योग्यता दे रखी है और विवेक भी दे रखा है। इसलिये लोकेऽस्मिन् पदसे विशेषरूपसे मनुष्यकी ओर ही लक्ष्य है। परन्तु भगवान् तो प्राणिमात्रमें समानरूपसे रहते हैं -- समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु (गीता 9। 29)। जहाँ भगवान् रहते हैं? वहाँ उनकी सम्पत्ति भी रहती है? इसलिये भूतसर्गौ पद दिया है। इससे यह सिद्ध हुआ कि प्राणिमात्र भगवान्की तरफ चल सकता है। भगवान्की तरफसे किसीको मना नहीं है।मनुष्योंमें जो सर्वथा दुराचारोंमें लगे हुए हैं? वे चाण्डाल और पशुपक्षी? कीटपतंगादि पापयोनिवालोंकी अपेक्षा भी अधिक दोषी हैं। कारण कि पापयोनिवालोंका तो पहलेके पापोंके कारण परवशतासे पापयोनिमें जन्म होता है और वहाँ उनका पुराने पापोंका फलभोग होता है परन्तु दुराचारी मनुष्य यहाँ जानबूझकर बुरे आचरणोंमें प्रवृत्त होते हैं अर्थात् नये पाप करते हैं। पापयोनिवाले तो पुराने पापोंका फल भोगकर उन्नतिकी ओर जाते हैं? और दुराचारी नयेनये पाप करके पतनकी ओर जाते हैं। ऐसे दुराचारियोंके लिये भी भगवान्ने कहा है कि यदि अत्यन्त दुराचारी भी मेरे अनन्य शरण होकर मेरा भजन करता है? तो वह भी सदा रहनेवाली शान्तिको प्राप्त कर लेता है (9। 30 -- 31)। ऐसे ही पापीसेपापी भी ज्ञानरूपी नौकासे सब पापोंको तरकर अपना उद्धार कर लेता है (4। 36)। तात्पर्य यह कि जब दुराचारीसेदुराचारी और पापीसेपापी व्यक्ति भी भक्ति और ज्ञान प्राप्त करके अपना उद्धार कर सकता है? तो फिर अन्य पापयोनियोंके लिये भगवान्की तरफसे मना कैसे हो सकती है इसलिये यहाँ भूत (प्राणिमात्र) शब्द दिया है।मानवेतर प्राणियोंमें भी दैवी प्रकृतिके पाये जानेकी बहुत बातें सुनने? पढ़ने तथा देखनेमें आती हैं। ऐसे कई उदाहरण आते हैं? जिसमें पशुपक्षियोंकी योनिमें भी दैवी गुण होनेकी बात आती है (टिप्पणी प0 813)। कई कुत्ते ऐसे भी देखे गये हैं? जो अमावस्या? एकादशी आदिका व्रत रखते हैं और उस दिन अन्न नहीं खाते। सत्सङ्गमें भी मनुष्येतर प्राणियोंके आकर बैठनेकी बातें सुनी हैं। सत्सङ्गमें साँपको भी आते देखा है। गोरखपुरमें जब बारहमहीनोंका कीर्तन हुआ था? तब एक काला कुत्ता कीर्तनमण्डलके बीचमें चलता और जहाँ सत्सङ्ग होता? वहाँ बैठ जाता। ऋषिकेश(स्वर्गाश्रम) में वटवृक्षके नीचे एक साँप आया करता था। वहाँ एक सन्त थे। एक दिन उन्होंने साँपसे कहा ठहर तो वह ठहर गया। सन्तने उसे गीता सुनायी? तो वह चुपचाप बैठ गया। गीता पूरी होते ही साँप वहाँसे चला गया और फिर कभी वहाँ नहीं आया। (इस तरहके पशुपक्षियोंमें ऐसी प्रकृति पूर्वसंस्कारवश स्वाभाविक होती है।)इस प्रकार पशुपक्षियोंमें भी दैवीसम्पत्तिके गुण देखनेमें आते हैं। हाँ? यह अवश्य है कि वहाँ दैवीसम्पत्तिके गुणोंके विकासका क्षेत्र और योग्यता नहीं है। उनके विकासका क्षेत्र और योग्यता केवल मनुष्यशरीरमें ही है।पशु? पक्षी? जड़ी? बूटी? वृक्ष? लता आदि जितने भी जङ्गमस्थावर प्राणी हैं? उन सभीमें दैवी और आसुरीसम्पत्तिवाले प्राणी होते हैं। मनुष्यको उन सबकी रक्षा करनी ही चाहिये क्योंकि सबकी रक्षाके लिये? सबका प्रबन्ध करनेके लिये ही यह मनुष्य बनाया गया है। उनमें भी जो सात्त्विक पशु? पक्षी? जड़ी? बूटी आदि हैं? उनकी तो विशेषतासे रक्षा करनी चाहिये क्योंकि उनकी रक्षासे हमारेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति बढ़ती है। जैसे? गोमाता हमारी पूजनीया है तो हमें उसकी रक्षा और पालन करना चाहिये क्योंकि गाय सम्पूर्ण सृष्टिका कारण है -- गावो विश्वस्य मातरः। गायके घीसे ही यज्ञ होता है भैंस आदिके घीसे नहीं। यज्ञसे वर्षा होती है। वर्षासे अन्न और अन्नसे प्राणी पैदा होते हैं। उन प्राणियोंमें खेतीके लिये बैलोंकी जरूरत होती है। वे बैल गायोंके होते हैं। बैलोंसे खेती होती है अर्थात् बैलोंसे हल आदि जोतकर तथा कुएँ आदिके जलसे सींचकर खेतीकी जाती है। खेतीसे अन्न? वस्त्र आदि निर्वाहकी चीजें पैदा होती हैं? जिनसे मनुष्य? पशु आदि सभीका जीवननिर्वाह होता है। निर्वाहमें भी गायके घीदूध हमारे खानेपीनेके काम आते हैं। उन घीदूधसे हमारे शरीरमें बल और अन्तःकरणमें सात्त्विक भाव बढ़ते हैं। इसी तरहसे जितनी जड़ीबूटियाँ हैं? उनमेंसे सात्त्विक जड़ीबूटीसे कायाकल्प होता है? रोग दूर होता है और शरीर पुष्ट होता है। इसलिये हम लोगोंको सात्त्विक पशु? पक्षी? जड़ीबूटी आदिकी विशेष रक्षा करनी चाहिये? जिससे हमारे इहलोक और परलोक दोनों सुधर जायँ।दैवो विस्तरशः प्रोक्तः -- भगवान् कहते हैं कि दैवीसम्पत्तिका मैंने विस्तारसे वर्णन कर दिया। इसी अध्यायके पहले श्लोकमें नौ? दूसरे श्लोकमें ग्यारह और तीसरे श्लोकमें छः -- इस तरह दैवीसम्पत्तिके कुल छब्बीस लक्षणोंका वर्णन किया गया है। इससे पहले भी गुणातीतके लक्षणोंमें (14। 22 -- 25)? ज्ञानके बीस साधनोंमें (13। 7 -- 11)? भक्तोंके लक्षणोंमें (12। 13 -- 19)? कर्मयोगीके लक्षणोंमे (6। 7 -- 9) और स्थितप्रज्ञके लक्षणोंमें (2। 55 -- 71) दैवीसम्पत्तिका विस्तारसे वर्णन हुआ है।आसुरं पार्थ मे श्रृणु -- भगवान् कहते हैं कि अब तू मुझसे आसुरीसम्पत्तिको विस्तारपूर्वक सुन अर्थात् जो मनुष्य केवल प्राणपोषणपरायण होते हैं? उनका स्वभाव कैसा होता है -- यह मेरेसे सुन। सम्बन्ध -- भगवान्से विमुख मनुष्यमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति किस क्रमसे (टिप्पणी प0 814) आती है? उसका आगेके श्लोकमें वर्णन करते हैं।",

वे सब दैवीसम्पदा हैं। जैसे भगवान् नित्य हैं? ऐसे ही उनकी साधनसम्पत्ति भी नित्य है। भगवान्ने परमात्मप्राप्तिके साधनको अव्यय अर्थात् अविनाशी कहा है -- इमं विवस्वते योगं प्रोक्तवानहमव्ययम् (गीता 4। 1)।द्वौ भूतसर्गौ में भूत शब्दसे मनुष्य? देवता? असुर? राक्षस? भूत? प्रेत? पिशाच? पशु? पक्षी? कीट? पतंग? वृक्ष? लता आदि सम्पूर्ण स्थावरजंगम प्राणी लिये जा सकते हैं। परन्तु आसुर स्वभावका त्याग करनेकी विवेकशक्ति मुख्यरूपसे मनुष्यशरीरमें ही है। इसलिये मनुष्यको आसुर स्वभावका सर्वथा त्याग करना चाहिये। उसका त्याग होते ही दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतः प्रकट हो जाती है।मनुष्यमें दैवी और आसुरी -- दोनों सम्पत्तियाँ रहती हैं -- सुमति कुमति सब कें उर रहहीं। नाथ पुरान निगम अस कहहीं।।(मानस 5। 40। 3)क्रूरसेक्रूर कसाईमें भी दया रहती है? चोरसेचोरमें भी साहूकारी रहती है। इसी तरह दैवीसम्पत्तिसे रहित कोई हो ही नहीं सकता क्योंकि जीवमात्र परमात्माका अंश है। उसमें दैवीसम्पत्ति स्वतःस्वाभाविक है और आसुरी सम्पत्ति अपनी बनायी हुई है। सच्चे हृदयसे परमात्माकी तरफ चलनेवाले साधकोंको आसुरीसम्पत्ति निरन्तर खटकती है? बुरी लगती है और उसको दूर करनेका वे प्रयत्न भी करते हैं। परन्तु जो लोग भजनस्मरणके साथ आसुरीसम्पत्तिका भी पोषण करते रहते हैं अर्थात् कुछ भजनस्मरण? नित्यकर्म आदि भी कर लेते हैं और सांसारिक भोग तथा संग्रहमें भी सुख लेते हैं और उसे आवश्यक समझते हैं? वे वास्तवमें साधक नहीं कहे जा सकते। कारण कि कुछ दैव स्वभाव और कुछ आसुर स्वभाव तो नीचसेनीच प्राणीमें भी स्वाभाविक रहता है।एक विशेष ध्यान देनेकी बात है कि अहंताके अनुरूप प्रवृत्ति होती है और प्रवृत्तिके अनुसार अहंताकी दृढ़ता होती है। जिसकी अहंतामें मैं सत्यवादी हूँ ऐसा भाव होगा? वह सत्य बोलेगा और सत्य बोलनेसे उसकी सत्यनिष्ठा दृढ़ हो जायगी। फिर वह कभी असत्य नहीं बोल सकेगा। परन्तु जिसकी अहंतामें मैं संसारी हूँ और संसारके भोग भोगना और संग्रह करना मेरा काम है ऐसे भाव होंगे? उसको झूठकपट करते देरी नहीं लगेगी। छूठकपट करनेसे उसकी अहंतामें ये भाव दृढ़ हो जाते हैं कि बिना झूठकपट किये किसीका काम नहीं चल ही नहीं सकता? जिसमें भी आजकलके जमानेमें तो ऐसा करना ही पड़ता है? इससे कोई बच नहीं सकता आदि। इस प्रकार अहंतामें दुर्भाव आनेसे ही दुराचारोंसे छूटना कठिन हो जाता है और इसी कारण लोग दुर्गुणदुराचारको छोड़ना कठिन या असम्भव मानते हैं।परमात्माका अंश होनेसे सद्भावसे रहित कोई नहीं हो सकता और शरीरके साथ अंहताममता रखते हुए दुर्भावसे सर्वथा रहित कोई नहीं हो सकता। दुर्भावोंके आनेपर भी सद्भावका बीज कभी नष्ट नहीं होता क्योंकि सद्भाव सत् है और सत्का कभी अभाव नहीं होता -- नाभावो विद्यते सतः (2। 16)। इसके विपरीत दुर्भाव कुसङ्गसे उत्पन्न होनेवाले हैं और उत्पन्न होनेवाली वस्तु नित्य नहीं होती -- नासतो विद्यते भावः (2। 16)।मनुष्योंकी सद्भाव या दुर्भावकी मुख्यताको लेकर ही प्रवृत्ति होती है। जब सद्भावकी मुख्यता होती है? तब वह सदाचार करता है और जब दुर्भावकी मुख्यता होती है? तब वह दुराचार करता है। तात्पर्य है कि जिसका उद्देश्य परमात्मप्राप्तिका हो जाता है? उसमें सद्भावकी मुख्यता हो जाती है और दुर्भाव मिटने लगते हैं और जिसका उद्देश्य सांसारिक भोग और संग्रहका हो जाता है? उसमें दुर्भावकी मुख्यता हो जाती है और सद्भाव छिपने लगते हैं।लोकेऽस्मिन् का तात्पर्य है कि नयेनये अधिकार पृथ्वीमण्डलमें ही मिलते हैं। पृथ्वीमण्डलमें भी भारतक्षेत्रमें विलक्षण अधिकार प्राप्त होते हैं। भारतभूमिपर जन्म लेनेवाले मनुष्योंकी देवताओंने भी प्रशंसा की है (टिप्पणी प0 812)। कल्याणका मौका मनुष्यलोकमें ही है। इस लोकमें आकर मनुष्यको विशेष सावधानीसे दैवीसम्पत्ति जाग्रत् करनी चाहिये। भगवान्ने विशेष कृपा करके ही यह मनुष्यशरीर दिया है --,कबहुँक करि करुना नर देही। देत ईस बिनु हेतु सनेही।।(मानस 7। 44। 3) ,जिन प्राणियोंको भगवान् मनुष्य बनाते हैं? उनपर भगवान् विश्वास करते हैं कि ये अपना कल्याण (उद्धार) करेंगे। इसी आशासे वे मनुष्यशरीर देते हैं। भगवान्ने विशेष कृपा करके मनुष्यको अपनी प्राप्तिकी सामग्री और योग्यता दे रखी है और विवेक भी दे रखा है। इसलिये लोकेऽस्मिन् पदसे विशेषरूपसे मनुष्यकी ओर ही लक्ष्य है। परन्तु भगवान् तो प्राणिमात्रमें समानरूपसे रहते हैं -- समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु (गीता 9। 29)। जहाँ भगवान् रहते हैं? वहाँ उनकी सम्पत्ति भी रहती है? इसलिये भूतसर्गौ पद दिया है। इससे यह सिद्ध हुआ कि प्राणिमात्र भगवान्की तरफ चल सकता है। भगवान्की तरफसे किसीको मना नहीं है।मनुष्योंमें जो सर्वथा दुराचारोंमें लगे हुए हैं? वे चाण्डाल और पशुपक्षी? कीटपतंगादि पापयोनिवालोंकी अपेक्षा भी अधिक दोषी हैं। कारण कि पापयोनिवालोंका तो पहलेके पापोंके कारण परवशतासे पापयोनिमें जन्म होता है और वहाँ उनका पुराने पापोंका फलभोग होता है परन्तु दुराचारी मनुष्य यहाँ जानबूझकर बुरे आचरणोंमें प्रवृत्त होते हैं अर्थात् नये पाप करते हैं। पापयोनिवाले तो पुराने पापोंका फल भोगकर उन्नतिकी ओर जाते हैं? और दुराचारी नयेनये पाप करके पतनकी ओर जाते हैं। ऐसे दुराचारियोंके लिये भी भगवान्ने कहा है कि यदि अत्यन्त दुराचारी भी मेरे अनन्य शरण होकर मेरा भजन करता है? तो वह भी सदा रहनेवाली शान्तिको प्राप्त कर लेता है (9। 30 -- 31)। ऐसे ही पापीसेपापी भी ज्ञानरूपी नौकासे सब पापोंको तरकर अपना उद्धार कर लेता है (4। 36)। तात्पर्य यह कि जब दुराचारीसेदुराचारी और पापीसेपापी व्यक्ति भी भक्ति और ज्ञान प्राप्त करके अपना उद्धार कर सकता है? तो फिर अन्य पापयोनियोंके लिये भगवान्की तरफसे मना कैसे हो सकती है इसलिये यहाँ भूत (प्राणिमात्र) शब्द दिया है।मानवेतर प्राणियोंमें भी दैवी प्रकृतिके पाये जानेकी बहुत बातें सुनने? पढ़ने तथा देखनेमें आती हैं। ऐसे कई उदाहरण आते हैं? जिसमें पशुपक्षियोंकी योनिमें भी दैवी गुण होनेकी बात आती है (टिप्पणी प0 813)। कई कुत्ते ऐसे भी देखे गये हैं? जो अमावस्या? एकादशी आदिका व्रत रखते हैं और उस दिन अन्न नहीं खाते। सत्सङ्गमें भी मनुष्येतर प्राणियोंके आकर बैठनेकी बातें सुनी हैं। सत्सङ्गमें साँपको भी आते देखा है। गोरखपुरमें जब बारहमहीनोंका कीर्तन हुआ था? तब एक काला कुत्ता कीर्तनमण्डलके बीचमें चलता और जहाँ सत्सङ्ग होता? वहाँ बैठ जाता। ऋषिकेश(स्वर्गाश्रम) में वटवृक्षके नीचे एक साँप आया करता था। वहाँ एक सन्त थे। एक दिन उन्होंने साँपसे कहा ठहर तो वह ठहर गया। सन्तने उसे गीता सुनायी? तो वह चुपचाप बैठ गया। गीता पूरी होते ही साँप वहाँसे चला गया और फिर कभी वहाँ नहीं आया। (इस तरहके पशुपक्षियोंमें ऐसी प्रकृति पूर्वसंस्कारवश स्वाभाविक होती है।)इस प्रकार पशुपक्षियोंमें भी दैवीसम्पत्तिके गुण देखनेमें आते हैं। हाँ? यह अवश्य है कि वहाँ दैवीसम्पत्तिके गुणोंके विकासका क्षेत्र और योग्यता नहीं है। उनके विकासका क्षेत्र और योग्यता केवल मनुष्यशरीरमें ही है।पशु? पक्षी? जड़ी? बूटी? वृक्ष? लता आदि जितने भी जङ्गमस्थावर प्राणी हैं? उन सभीमें दैवी और आसुरीसम्पत्तिवाले प्राणी होते हैं। मनुष्यको उन सबकी रक्षा करनी ही चाहिये क्योंकि सबकी रक्षाके लिये? सबका प्रबन्ध करनेके लिये ही यह मनुष्य बनाया गया है। उनमें भी जो सात्त्विक पशु? पक्षी? जड़ी? बूटी आदि हैं? उनकी तो विशेषतासे रक्षा करनी चाहिये क्योंकि उनकी रक्षासे हमारेमें दैवीसम्पत्ति बढ़ती है। जैसे? गोमाता हमारी पूजनीया है तो हमें उसकी रक्षा और पालन करना चाहिये क्योंकि गाय सम्पूर्ण सृष्टिका कारण है -- गावो विश्वस्य मातरः। गायके घीसे ही यज्ञ होता है भैंस आदिके घीसे नहीं। यज्ञसे वर्षा होती है। वर्षासे अन्न और अन्नसे प्राणी पैदा होते हैं। उन प्राणियोंमें खेतीके लिये बैलोंकी जरूरत होती है। वे बैल गायोंके होते हैं। बैलोंसे खेती होती है अर्थात् बैलोंसे हल आदि जोतकर तथा कुएँ आदिके जलसे सींचकर खेतीकी जाती है। खेतीसे अन्न? वस्त्र आदि निर्वाहकी चीजें पैदा होती हैं? जिनसे मनुष्य? पशु आदि सभीका जीवननिर्वाह होता है। निर्वाहमें भी गायके घीदूध हमारे खानेपीनेके काम आते हैं। उन घीदूधसे हमारे शरीरमें बल और अन्तःकरणमें सात्त्विक भाव बढ़ते हैं। इसी तरहसे जितनी जड़ीबूटियाँ हैं? उनमेंसे सात्त्विक जड़ीबूटीसे कायाकल्प होता है? रोग दूर होता है और शरीर पुष्ट होता है। इसलिये हम लोगोंको सात्त्विक पशु? पक्षी? जड़ीबूटी आदिकी विशेष रक्षा करनी चाहिये? जिससे हमारे इहलोक और परलोक दोनों सुधर जायँ।दैवो विस्तरशः प्रोक्तः -- भगवान् कहते हैं कि दैवीसम्पत्तिका मैंने विस्तारसे वर्णन कर दिया। इसी अध्यायके पहले श्लोकमें नौ? दूसरे श्लोकमें ग्यारह और तीसरे श्लोकमें छः -- इस तरह दैवीसम्पत्तिके कुल छब्बीस लक्षणोंका वर्णन किया गया है। इससे पहले भी गुणातीतके लक्षणोंमें (14। 22 -- 25)? ज्ञानके बीस साधनोंमें (13। 7 -- 11)? भक्तोंके लक्षणोंमें (12। 13 -- 19)? कर्मयोगीके लक्षणोंमे (6। 7 -- 9) और स्थितप्रज्ञके लक्षणोंमें (2। 55 -- 71) दैवीसम्पत्तिका विस्तारसे वर्णन हुआ है।आसुरं पार्थ मे श्रृणु -- भगवान् कहते हैं कि अब तू मुझसे आसुरीसम्पत्तिको विस्तारपूर्वक सुन अर्थात् जो मनुष्य केवल प्राणपोषणपरायण होते हैं? उनका स्वभाव कैसा होता है -- यह मेरेसे सुन। सम्बन्ध -- भगवान्से विमुख मनुष्यमें आसुरीसम्पत्ति किस क्रमसे (टिप्पणी प0 814) आती है? उसका आगेके श्लोकमें वर्णन करते हैं।",

            "Hindi": "यद्यपि भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण यहाँ केवल दो प्रकार के दैवी और आसुरी लोगों का ही उल्लेख करते हैं? परन्तु वस्तुत सृष्टि में एक और प्रकार के लोग भी हैं जो सुधार के सर्वथा अयोग्य होते हैं। ये हैं राक्षसी प्रवृत्ति के लोग जिनके विषय में भगवान् सर्वथा मौन हैं। उनका यह मौन? संभवत उनकी वक्तृता से भी अधिक बोधक है धर्म और आत्मविकास की साधनाओं का उपदेश प्रथम दो प्रकार के लोगों के लिए है? राक्षसों के लिए नही? क्योंकि उनका अभी पर्याप्त विकास नहीं हुआ है वे अभी भी प्राणियों को गढ़ने वाली प्रकृति के हाथों में हैं और उन्हें अभी जीवन के सन्तप्त करने वाले अनुभवों की अग्नि में परिपक्व होने की आवश्यकता है। पर्याप्त विकास को प्राप्त होने पर ये राक्षसी लोग असुरों की श्रेणी में आ जाते हैं? जहाँ से आगे का पथप्रदर्शन उन्हें धर्म के द्वारा किया जाता है। इस प्रकार? दैवी स्वभाव के उत्पन्न हो जाने पर उनके लिए आत्मविचार के द्वारा आत्मसाक्षात्कार का मार्ग प्रशस्त हो जाता है।इस अध्याय के चौथे श्लोक में आसुरी सम्पदा का संक्षिप्त रेखाचित्र ही चित्रित किया गया था जिसका सम्पूर्ण विस्तृत विवरण प्रस्तुत खण्ड में दिया गया है। विश्व के प्राय समस्त धर्मग्रन्थों में नैतिकता और सदाचार के सद्गुणों का तो स्तुतिगान गाया गया है परन्तु आसुरी पुरुष के अवगुणों का विस्तृत वर्णन उसमें क्वचित् ही मिलता है। हिन्दू धर्म के कुछ आलोचक जब हमारे धर्मशास्त्रों में ऐसे वर्णन को पाते हैं? तो टीका के योग्य विषय मिलने के कारण वे प्रसन्न हो जाते हैं। असुरों का वर्णन करना धर्मशास्त्रों एवं ऋषि मुनियों के लिए दूषणास्पद है? ऐसा उनका मत है। इस प्रकार की आलोचना विशेषत उन्नीसवीं शताब्दि के आलोचकों के द्वारा अधिक की जाती थी। परन्तु अब? बीसवीं शताब्दि में मनोविज्ञान के क्षेत्र में हुए अनुसन्धानों के परिणामों के कारण उन्हें मौन धारण करना पड़ा है। मनोविज्ञान्ा के अनुसार? अपने अवगुणों का तीव्रता से भान होना और अपनी हीन प्रवृत्तियों के प्रति घृणा उत्पन्न होना ही उनके निराकरण का सरल उपाय है। मनोविज्ञान के क्षेत्र में इस आधार पर सफल प्रयोग भी किये गये हैं।अशुभ? शुभ का केवल विरोधी ही नहीं है। ऐसा नहीं है कि शुभ प्रकृति के एक प्रकार के गुण हैं? तो अशुभ प्रकृति के उससे भिन्न लक्षण हैं। मनुष्य की प्रवृत्तियाँ विशिष्ट प्रकार की होती हैं? और शुभ और अशुभ दोनों ही उसके हृदय की अभिव्यक्तियाँ हैं। शुभ का त्रुटिपूर्ण अर्थ ही अशुभ है। इसलिए? आसुरी गुणों की इस सूची में हमें कोई पूर्वकथित दैवी गुणों के विरोधी लक्षणों की नीरस गणना नहीं मिलेगी। असुरों के स्वभाव का अध्ययन करने पर ज्ञात होगा कि मूलत उनके गुण सत्पुरुषों के समान ही होते हैं? परन्तु उनका दुरुपयोग त्रुटिपूर्ण मूल्यांकन के कारण अति उत्साह में आकर विपरीत दिशा में किया जाता है। अज्ञान से विषाक्त सद्गुण ही अवगुण बन जाता है? और अवगुण का उपचार करने पर वह विषमुक्त होकर सद्गुणरूपी स्वास्थ्य को पुन प्राप्त कर लेता है।इस प्रकार? आसुरी स्वभाव का वर्णन करने वाले इस खण्ड के प्रथम श्लोक में ही? मानो? उनके लिए क्षमा याचना करते हुए तथा उनके प्रति हमारे हृदय में छिपी करुणा को उजागर करते हुए भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण कहते हैं",

            "Devnagri": "यद्यपि भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण यहाँ केवल दो प्रकार के दैवी और आसुरी लोगों का ही उल्लेख करते हैं? परन्तु वस्तुत सृष्टि में एक और प्रकार के लोग भी हैं जो सुधार के सर्वथा अयोग्य होते हैं। ये हैं राक्षसी प्रवृत्ति के लोग जिनके विषय में भगवान् सर्वथा मौन हैं। उनका यह मौन? संभवत उनकी वक्तृता से भी अधिक बोधक है धर्म और आत्मविकास की साधनाओं का उपदेश प्रथम दो प्रकार के लोगों के लिए है? राक्षसों के लिए नही? क्योंकि उनका अभी पर्याप्त विकास नहीं हुआ है वे अभी भी प्राणियों को गढ़ने वाली प्रकृति के हाथों में हैं और उन्हें अभी जीवन के सन्तप्त करने वाले अनुभवों की अग्नि में परिपक्व होने की आवश्यकता है। पर्याप्त विकास को प्राप्त होने पर ये राक्षसी लोग असुरों की श्रेणी में आ जाते हैं? जहाँ से आगे का पथप्रदर्शन उन्हें धर्म के द्वारा किया जाता है। इस प्रकार? दैवी स्वभाव के उत्पन्न हो जाने पर उनके लिए आत्मविचार के द्वारा आत्मसाक्षात्कार का मार्ग प्रशस्त हो जाता है।इस अध्याय के चौथे श्लोक में आसुरी सम्पदा का संक्षिप्त रेखाचित्र ही चित्रित किया गया था जिसका सम्पूर्ण विस्तृत विवरण प्रस्तुत खण्ड में दिया गया है। विश्व के प्राय समस्त धर्मग्रन्थों में नैतिकता और सदाचार के सद्गुणों का तो स्तुतिगान गाया गया है परन्तु आसुरी पुरुष के अवगुणों का विस्तृत वर्णन उसमें क्वचित् ही मिलता है। हिन्दू धर्म के कुछ आलोचक जब हमारे धर्मशास्त्रों में ऐसे वर्णन को पाते हैं? तो टीका के योग्य विषय मिलने के कारण वे प्रसन्न हो जाते हैं। असुरों का वर्णन करना धर्मशास्त्रों एवं ऋषि मुनियों के लिए दूषणास्पद है? ऐसा उनका मत है। इस प्रकार की आलोचना विशेषत उन्नीसवीं शताब्दि के आलोचकों के द्वारा अधिक की जाती थी। परन्तु अब? बीसवीं शताब्दि में मनोविज्ञान के क्षेत्र में हुए अनुसन्धानों के परिणामों के कारण उन्हें मौन धारण करना पड़ा है। मनोविज्ञान्ा के अनुसार? अपने अवगुणों का तीव्रता से भान होना और अपनी हीन प्रवृत्तियों के प्रति घृणा उत्पन्न होना ही उनके निराकरण का सरल उपाय है। मनोविज्ञान के क्षेत्र में इस आधार पर सफल प्रयोग भी किये गये हैं।अशुभ? शुभ का केवल विरोधी ही नहीं है। ऐसा नहीं है कि शुभ प्रकृति के एक प्रकार के गुण हैं? तो अशुभ प्रकृति के उससे भिन्न लक्षण हैं। मनुष्य की प्रवृत्तियाँ विशिष्ट प्रकार की होती हैं? और शुभ और अशुभ दोनों ही उसके हृदय की अभिव्यक्तियाँ हैं। शुभ का त्रुटिपूर्ण अर्थ ही अशुभ है। इसलिए? आसुरी गुणों की इस सूची में हमें कोई पूर्वकथित दैवी गुणों के विरोधी लक्षणों की नीरस गणना नहीं मिलेगी। असुरों के स्वभाव का अध्ययन करने पर ज्ञात होगा कि मूलत उनके गुण सत्पुरुषों के समान ही होते हैं? परन्तु उनका दुरुपयोग त्रुटिपूर्ण मूल्यांकन के कारण अति उत्साह में आकर विपरीत दिशा में किया जाता है। अज्ञान से विषाक्त सद्गुण ही अवगुण बन जाता है? और अवगुण का उपचार करने पर वह विषमुक्त होकर सद्गुणरूपी स्वास्थ्य को पुन प्राप्त कर लेता है।इस प्रकार? आसुरी स्वभाव का वर्णन करने वाले इस खण्ड के प्रथम श्लोक में ही? मानो? उनके लिए क्षमा याचना करते हुए तथा उनके प्रति हमारे हृदय में छिपी करुणा को उजागर करते हुए भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण कहते हैं",

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या -- प्रवृत्तिं च निवृत्तिं च जना न विदुरासुराः -- आजकलके उच्छृङ्खल वातावरण? खानपान? शिक्षा आदिके प्रभावसे प्रायः मनुष्य प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्तिको अर्थात् किसमें प्रवृत्त होना चाहिये और किससे निवृत्त होना चाहिये -- इसको नहीं जानते और जानना चाहते भी नहीं। कोई इसको बताना चाहे? तो उसकी मानते नहीं? प्रत्युत उसकी हँसी उड़ाते हैं? उसे मूर्ख समझते हैं और अभिमानके कारण अपनेको बड़ा बुद्धिमान् समझते हैं। कुछ लोग (प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्तिको) जानते भी हैं? पर उनपर आसुरीसम्पदाका विशेष प्रभाव होनेसे उनकी विहित कार्योंमें प्रवृत्ति और निषिद्ध कार्योंसे निवृत्ति नहीं होती। इस कारण सबसे पहले आसुरीसम्पत्ति आती है -- प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्तिको न जाननेसे।प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्तिको कैसे जाना जाय इसे गुरुके द्वारा? ग्रन्थके द्वारा? विचारके द्वारा जाना जा सकता है इसके अलावा उस मनुष्यपर कोई आफत आ जाय? वह मुसीबतमें फँस जाय? कोई विचित्र घटना घट जाय? तो विवेकशक्ति जाग्रत् हो जाती है। किसी महापुरुषके दर्शन हो जानेसे पूर्वसंस्कारवश मनुष्यकी वृत्ति बदल जाती है अथवा जिन स्थानोंपर बड़ेबड़े प्रभावशाली सन्त हुए हैं? उन स्थलोंमें? तीर्थोंमें जानेसे भी विवेकशक्ति जाग्रत् हो जाती है।विवेकशक्ति प्राणिमात्रमें रहती है। परन्तु पशुपक्षी आदि योनियोंमें इसको विकसित करनेका अवसर? स्थान और योग्यता नहीं है एवं मनुष्यमें उसको विकसित करनेका अवसर? स्थान और योग्यता भी है। पशुपक्षी आदिमें वह विवेकशक्ति केवल अपने शरीरनिर्वाहतक ही सीमित रहती है? पर मनुष्य उस विवेकशक्तिसे अपना और अपने परिवारका तथा अन्य प्राणियोंका भी पालनपोषण कर सकता है? और दुर्गुणदुराचारोंका त्याग करके सद्गुणसदाचारोंको भी ला सकता है। मनुष्य इसमें सर्वथा स्वतन्त्र है क्योंकि वह साधनयोनि है। परन्तु पक्षुपक्षी इसमें स्वतन्त्र नहीं हैं क्योंकि वह भोगयोनि है।जब मनुष्योंकी खानेपीने आदिमें ही विशेष वृत्ति रहती है? तब उनमें कर्तव्यअकर्तव्यका होश नहीं रहता। ऐसे मनुष्योंमें पशुओंकी तरह दैवीसम्पत्ति छिपी हुई रहती है? सामने नहीं आती। ऐसे मनुष्योंके लिये भी भगवान्ने जनाः पद दिया है अर्थात् वे भी मनुष्य कहलानेके लायक हैं क्योंकि उनमें दैवीसम्पत्ति प्रकट हो सकती है।विशेष बातजनाः (16। 7) से लेकर नराधमान् (16। 19) पदतक बीचमें आये हुए श्लोकोंमें कहीं भी भगवान्ने मनुष्यवाचक शब्द नहीं दिया है। इसका तात्पर्य यह है कि यद्यपि मनुष्यमें आसुरीसम्पत्तिका त्याग करनेकी तथा दैवीसम्पत्तिको धारण करनेकी योग्यता है? तथापि जो मनुष्य होकर भी दैवीसम्पत्तिको धारण न करके आसुरीसम्पत्तिको बनाये रखते हैं? वे मनुष्य कहलानेलायक नहीं हैं। वे पशुओंसे और नारकीय प्राणियोंसे भी गयेबीते हैं क्योंकि पशु और नारकीय प्राणी तो पापोंका फल भोगकर पवित्रताकी तरफ जा रहे हैं और ये आसुर स्वभाववाले मनुष्य जिस पुण्यसे मनुष्यशरीर मिला है? उसको नष्ट करके और यहाँ नयेनये पाप बटोरकर पशुपक्षी आदि योनियों तथा नरकोंकी तरफ जा रहे हैं। अतः उनकी दुर्गतिका वर्णन इसी अध्यायके सोलहवें और उन्नीसवें श्लोकोंमें किया गया है।भगवान्ने आसुर मनुष्योंके जितने लक्षण बताये हैं? उनमें उनको पशु आदिका विशेषण न देकर अशुभान्?,नराधमान् विशेषण दिये हैं। कारण यह कि पशु आदि इतने पापी नहीं हैं और उनके दर्शनसे पाप भी नहीं लगता? पर आसुर मनुष्योंमें विशेष पाप होते हैं और उनके दर्शनसे पाप लगता है? अपवित्रता आती है। इसी अध्यायके बाईसवें श्लोकमें नरः पद देकर यह बताते हैं कि जो कामक्रोधलोभरूप नरकके द्वारोंसे छूटकर,अपने कल्याणका आचरण करता है? वही मनुष्य कहलानेलायक है। पाँचवें अध्यायके तेईसवें श्लोकमें भी नरः पदसे इसी बातको पुष्ट किया गया है।न शौचं नापि चाचारो न सत्यं तेषु विद्यते -- प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्तिको न जाननेसे उन आसुर स्वभाववालोंमें शुद्धिअशुद्धिका खयाल नहीं रहता। उनको सांसारिक बर्तावका? व्यवहारका भी खयाल नहीं होता अर्थात् मातापिता आदि बड़ेबूढ़ोंके साथ तथा अन्य मनुष्योंके साथ कैसा बर्ताव करना चाहिये और कैसे नहीं करना चाहिये -- इस बातको वे जानते ही नहीं। उनमें सत्य नहीं होता अर्थात् वे असत्य बोलते हैं और आचरण भी असत्य ही करते हैं। इन सबका तात्पर्य यह है कि वे पुरुष असुर हैं। खानापीना? आरामसे रहना तथा मैं जीता रहूँ? संसारका सुख भोगता रहूँ और संग्रह करता रहूँ आदि उद्देश्य होनेसे उनकी शौचाचार और सदाचारकी तरफ दृष्टि ही नहीं जाती।भगवान्ने दूसरे अध्यायके चौवालीसवें श्लोकमें बताया है कि वैदिक प्रक्रियाके अनुसार सांसारिक भोग और संग्रहमें लगे हुए पुरुषोंमें भी परमात्माकी प्राप्तिका एक निश्चय नहीं होता। भाव यह है कि आसुरीसम्पदाका अंश रहनेके कारण जब ऐसे शास्त्रविधिसे यज्ञादि कर्मोंमें लगे हुए पुरुष भी परमात्माका एक निश्चय नहीं कर पाते? तब जिन पुरुषोंमें आसुरीसम्पदा विशेष बढ़ी हुई है अर्थात् जो अन्यायपूर्वक भोग और संग्रहमें लगे हुए हैं? उनकी बुद्धिमें परमात्माका एक निश्चय होना कितना कठिन है (टिप्पणी प0 815) सम्बन्ध -- जहाँ सत्कर्मोंमें प्रवृत्ति नहीं होती? वहाँ सद्भावोंका भी निरादर होता है अर्थात् सद्भाव दबते चले जाते हैं -- अब इसको बताते हैं।",

            "Devnagri": "व्याख्या -- प्रवृत्तिं च निवृत्तिं च जना न विदुरासुराः -- आजकलके उच्छृङ्खल वातावरण? खानपान? शिक्षा आदिके प्रभावसे प्रायः मनुष्य प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्तिको अर्थात् किसमें प्रवृत्त होना चाहिये और किससे निवृत्त होना चाहिये -- इसको नहीं जानते और जानना चाहते भी नहीं। कोई इसको बताना चाहे? तो उसकी मानते नहीं? प्रत्युत उसकी हँसी उड़ाते हैं? उसे मूर्ख समझते हैं और अभिमानके कारण अपनेको बड़ा बुद्धिमान् समझते हैं। कुछ लोग (प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्तिको) जानते भी हैं? पर उनपर आसुरीसम्पदाका विशेष प्रभाव होनेसे उनकी विहित कार्योंमें प्रवृत्ति और निषिद्ध कार्योंसे निवृत्ति नहीं होती। इस कारण सबसे पहले आसुरीसम्पत्ति आती है -- प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्तिको न जाननेसे।प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्तिको कैसे जाना जाय इसे गुरुके द्वारा? ग्रन्थके द्वारा? विचारके द्वारा जाना जा सकता है इसके अलावा उस मनुष्यपर कोई आफत आ जाय? वह मुसीबतमें फँस जाय? कोई विचित्र घटना घट जाय? तो विवेकशक्ति जाग्रत् हो जाती है। किसी महापुरुषके दर्शन हो जानेसे पूर्वसंस्कारवश मनुष्यकी वृत्ति बदल जाती है अथवा जिन स्थानोंपर बड़ेबड़े प्रभावशाली सन्त हुए हैं? उन स्थलोंमें? तीर्थोंमें जानेसे भी विवेकशक्ति जाग्रत् हो जाती है।विवेकशक्ति प्राणिमात्रमें रहती है। परन्तु पशुपक्षी आदि योनियोंमें इसको विकसित करनेका अवसर? स्थान और योग्यता नहीं है एवं मनुष्यमें उसको विकसित करनेका अवसर? स्थान और योग्यता भी है। पशुपक्षी आदिमें वह विवेकशक्ति केवल अपने शरीरनिर्वाहतक ही सीमित रहती है? पर मनुष्य उस विवेकशक्तिसे अपना और अपने परिवारका तथा अन्य प्राणियोंका भी पालनपोषण कर सकता है? और दुर्गुणदुराचारोंका त्याग करके सद्गुणसदाचारोंको भी ला सकता है। मनुष्य इसमें सर्वथा स्वतन्त्र है क्योंकि वह साधनयोनि है। परन्तु पक्षुपक्षी इसमें स्वतन्त्र नहीं हैं क्योंकि वह भोगयोनि है।जब मनुष्योंकी खानेपीने आदिमें ही विशेष वृत्ति रहती है? तब उनमें कर्तव्यअकर्तव्यका होश नहीं रहता। ऐसे मनुष्योंमें पशुओंकी तरह दैवीसम्पत्ति छिपी हुई रहती है? सामने नहीं आती। ऐसे मनुष्योंके लिये भी भगवान्ने जनाः पद दिया है अर्थात् वे भी मनुष्य कहलानेके लायक हैं क्योंकि उनमें दैवीसम्पत्ति प्रकट हो सकती है।विशेष बातजनाः (16। 7) से लेकर नराधमान् (16। 19) पदतक बीचमें आये हुए श्लोकोंमें कहीं भी भगवान्ने मनुष्यवाचक शब्द नहीं दिया है। इसका तात्पर्य यह है कि यद्यपि मनुष्यमें आसुरीसम्पत्तिका त्याग करनेकी तथा दैवीसम्पत्तिको धारण करनेकी योग्यता है? तथापि जो मनुष्य होकर भी दैवीसम्पत्तिको धारण न करके आसुरीसम्पत्तिको बनाये रखते हैं? वे मनुष्य कहलानेलायक नहीं हैं। वे पशुओंसे और नारकीय प्राणियोंसे भी गयेबीते हैं क्योंकि पशु और नारकीय प्राणी तो पापोंका फल भोगकर पवित्रताकी तरफ जा रहे हैं और ये आसुर स्वभाववाले मनुष्य जिस पुण्यसे मनुष्यशरीर मिला है? उसको नष्ट करके और यहाँ नयेनये पाप बटोरकर पशुपक्षी आदि योनियों तथा नरकोंकी तरफ जा रहे हैं। अतः उनकी दुर्गतिका वर्णन इसी अध्यायके सोलहवें और उन्नीसवें श्लोकोंमें किया गया है।भगवान्ने आसुर मनुष्योंके जितने लक्षण बताये हैं? उनमें उनको पशु आदिका विशेषण न देकर अशुभान्?,नराधमान् विशेषण दिये हैं। कारण यह कि पशु आदि इतने पापी नहीं हैं और उनके दर्शनसे पाप भी नहीं लगता? पर आसुर मनुष्योंमें विशेष पाप होते हैं और उनके दर्शनसे पाप लगता है? अपवित्रता आती है। इसी अध्यायके बाईसवें श्लोकमें नरः पद देकर यह बताते हैं कि जो कामक्रोधलोभरूप नरकके द्वारोंसे छूटकर,अपने कल्याणका आचरण करता है? वही मनुष्य कहलानेलायक है। पाँचवें अध्यायके तेईसवें श्लोकमें भी नरः पदसे इसी बातको पुष्ट किया गया है।न शौचं नापि चाचारो न सत्यं तेषु विद्यते -- प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्तिको न जाननेसे उन आसुर स्वभाववालोंमें शुद्धिअशुद्धिका खयाल नहीं रहता। उनको सांसारिक बर्तावका? व्यवहारका भी खयाल नहीं होता अर्थात् मातापिता आदि बड़ेबूढ़ोंके साथ तथा अन्य मनुष्योंके साथ कैसा बर्ताव करना चाहिये और कैसे नहीं करना चाहिये -- इस बातको वे जानते ही नहीं। उनमें सत्य नहीं होता अर्थात् वे असत्य बोलते हैं और आचरण भी असत्य ही करते हैं। इन सबका तात्पर्य यह है कि वे पुरुष असुर हैं। खानापीना? आरामसे रहना तथा मैं जीता रहूँ? संसारका सुख भोगता रहूँ और संग्रह करता रहूँ आदि उद्देश्य होनेसे उनकी शौचाचार और सदाचारकी तरफ दृष्टि ही नहीं जाती।भगवान्ने दूसरे अध्यायके चौवालीसवें श्लोकमें बताया है कि वैदिक प्रक्रियाके अनुसार सांसारिक भोग और संग्रहमें लगे हुए पुरुषोंमें भी परमात्माकी प्राप्तिका एक निश्चय नहीं होता। भाव यह है कि आसुरीसम्पदाका अंश रहनेके कारण जब ऐसे शास्त्रविधिसे यज्ञादि कर्मोंमें लगे हुए पुरुष भी परमात्माका एक निश्चय नहीं कर पाते? तब जिन पुरुषोंमें आसुरीसम्पदा विशेष बढ़ी हुई है अर्थात् जो अन्यायपूर्वक भोग और संग्रहमें लगे हुए हैं? उनकी बुद्धिमें परमात्माका एक निश्चय होना कितना कठिन है (टिप्पणी प0 815) सम्बन्ध -- जहाँ सत्कर्मोंमें प्रवृत्ति नहीं होती? वहाँ सद्भावोंका भी निरादर होता है अर्थात् सद्भाव दबते चले जाते हैं -- अब इसको बताते हैं।",

            "Hindi": "यहाँ प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्ति के शब्द क्रमश कर्तव्य कर्म और अकर्तव्य अर्थात् निषिद्ध कर्म हैं।धार्मिक अनुष्ठानकर्ता कर्तव्य पालन और निस्वार्थ समाज सेवा के द्वारा न केवल तात्कालिक लाभ को प्राप्त करता है अपितु अन्तकरण की शुद्धि भी प्राप्त करता है? क्योंकि वह कभी अपने सर्वोच्च लक्ष्य को विस्मृत नहीं होने देता। निषिद्ध कर्मों से विरति ही निवृत्ति कहलाती है। अकर्तव्य का त्याग ही मनुष्य के लिए श्रेयस्कर होता है। असुर लोगों को कर्तव्य और अकर्तव्य का सर्वथा अज्ञान होता है। यहाँ ध्यान देने योग्य बात यह है कि आसुरी गुणों की सूची अज्ञान से प्रारम्भ होती है। यदि कोई व्यक्ति अज्ञानवशात् किसी प्रकार का अपराध करता है? तो समाज के सहृदय पुरुषों के मन में उसके प्रति क्षमा का भाव सहज उदित होता है? भले ही न्यायालय में उसे क्षमा के योग्य कारण न माना जाये।बाह्य शुद्धि? बहुत कुछ मात्रा में मनुष्य के आन्तरिक व्यक्तित्व की परिचायक होती है। श्रेष्ठ शिक्षा और संस्कारी पुरुष में ही यह शुद्धि हमें देखने को मिलती है।अज्ञानी पुरुष में अन्तर्बाह्य शुद्धि का अभाव होता है। ऐसे अनुशासनविहीन पुरुष का व्यवहार (आचार) भी विनयपूर्ण नहीं हो सकता? क्योंकि बाह्य आचरण मनुष्य के स्वभाव की ही अभिव्यक्ति है। इसलिए भगवान् कहते हैं कि आसुरी लोगों में सदाचार का अभाव स्पष्ट रूप से परिलक्षित होता है।अविवेक? अशौच तथा अनाचार से युक्त पुरुष अपने वचनों की सत्यता का पालन कभी नहीं कर सकता। यदि हम इन उल्लिखित गुणों का सावधानीपूर्वक अध्ययन करें? तो हमें स्पष्ट बोध होगा कि भगवान् के हृदय में इन दुराचारियों के प्रति कितनी करुणा है। सम्पूर्ण गीता में? इनके प्रति रञ्चमात्र भी प्रतिशोध या द्वेष का भाव प्रकट नहीं किया गया है। हम यह नहीं कह सकते कि आसुरी पुरुष जानबूझ कर असत्य का अनुकरण करता है। वास्तविकता यह है कि वह अपने स्वभाव से विवश निष्कपट व्यवहार करने में स्वयं को सर्वथा असमर्थ पाता है।",

Hence they say that the world is godless. Moreover, it is aparaspara-sambhutam, born of mutual union. The whole world is born of the union of the male and female impelled by passion. (That union is) kama-haitukam, brought about by passion. Kama-haitukam and kama-hetukam are the same. Kim anyat, what other (cause can there be)? There exists to other unseen cause such as righteousness, unrigtheousness, etc. Certainly, the passion of living beings is the cause of the world. This is the view of the materialists.",

          "Ramanujacharya (English)": "They maintain that the universe is 'without truth,' viz., they do not accept that this universe, which is the effect of Brahman denoted by the term Satya, has Brahman for its Self. They contend that it is bereft of any 'foundation,' viz., they do not accept that it has Brahman for its foundation. Brahman as Ananta supports the earth and bears all the worlds, as declared in 'This earth, sustained upon the head of this great serpent, supports in its turn, this garland of worlds, along with their men, demons and gods' (V.P., 2.5.27). They say that it is 'without a Lord,' viz. they don't accept that this universe is controlled by Me, the Lord of all, the Supreme Brahman, whose will is always true. It has been already averred: 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8). And they also contend thus: 'What else can exist without mutual causation?' i.e., except by the union of the male and the female among men, beasts etc. What else exists apart from this nature? The meaning is that nothing else is seen. Therefore the entire world is rooted in sexual lust.",

They do not believe in the existence of Brahman Who is the support of this world. They do not even accept the existence of an Isvara in this world. They say We are unreal. Therefore this world also is unreal, the scriptures which declare the truth are also unreal. What else but lust can be the cause of this universe Sexual passion is the sole cause of all living creatures. There is no such thing as the theory of Karma. The whole world is caused by the mutual union of man and woman under the impulse of lust. There is neither virtue nor vice. There is no Lord Who dispenses the fruits of actions of the individuals according to virtue and vice. Dharma and Adharma are not the basis of this world. Sexual desire is the sole basis for this universe. This world is a world of chance. They are not endowed with the faculty of introspection. They are ignorant of the field (Nature) and knower of the field (God).Mutual union Sexual union it may mean the union of atoms. The world arose from the combination of atoms according to the Vaiseshikas."

They are of 'fele understanding,' they lack the discernment that the self is to be known as different from the body, because of Its being the knower in the body which is an object of knowledge such as jars etc. These are of 'cruel deeds' viz., they do much harm to everybody; they are born to bring ruin to the world.",

Their minds are saturated with vanity, conceit and arrogance. They entertain in their minds unholy resolves and unreasonable ideas. They harbour insatiable desires in their hearts. Just as a monkey becomes more and more intoxicated if wine if given to it, so also the older they grow the more and more arrogant and lustful do they become. They cause the ruin and death of those around them. They boast of their own actions and treat others with great contempt. They are very much attached to their bodies. They worship their bodies. Their passion is boundless. They are stupid and obstinate and so they have no firm determination.Desire is insatiable like fire. Enjoyment cannot bring about satisfaction of the desires. The more you enjoy, the stronger does the desire become. After an object is enjoyed, there springs up a desire to continue the enjoyment for ever. You take recourse to all sorts of devices to preserve the objects.Although a man is not righteous he pretends to be a man of righteousness. This is hypocrisy. Although a man is not worthy of being honoured, he claims to be so. This is Mana (pride). There is false dignity. Although a man does not possess great things he superimposes them on himself. This is Mada.These Asuras make impure resolves. I will worship such and such a deity by repeating such and such a Mantra and get hold of such and such a woman. I will repeat such and such a Mantra and kill such and such a man."

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या -- काममाश्रित्य दुष्पूरम् -- वे आसुरी प्रकृतिवाले कभी भी पूरी न होनेवाली कामनाओंका आश्रय लेते हैं। जैसे कोई मनुष्य भगवान्का? कोई कर्तव्यका? कोई धर्मका? कोई स्वर्ग आदिका आश्रय लेता है? ऐसे ही आसुर प्राणी कभी पूरी न होनेवाली कामनाओंका आश्रय लेते हैं। उनके मनमें यह बात अच्छी तरहसे जँची हुई रहती है कि कामनाके बिना आदमी पत्थरजैसा हो जाता है कामनाके आश्रयके बिना आदमीकी उन्नति हो ही नहीं सकती आज जितने आदमी नेता? पण्डित? धनी आदि हो गये हैं? वे सब कामनाके कारण ही हुए हैं। इस प्रकार कामनाके आश्रित रहनेवाले भगवान्को? परलोकको? प्रारब्ध आदिको नहीं मानते।अब उन कामनाओंकी पूर्ति किनके द्वारा करें उसके साथी (सहायक) कौन हैं तो बताते हैं --,दम्भमानमदान्विताः। वे दम्भ? मान? और मदसे युक्त रहते हैं अर्थात् वे उनकी कामनापूर्तिके बल हैं। जहाँ जिनके सामने जैसा बननेसे अपना मतलब सिद्ध होता हो अर्थात् धन? मान? बड़ाई? पूजाप्रतिष्ठा? आदरसत्कार? वाहवाह आदि मिलते हों? वहाँ उनके सामने वैसा ही अपनेको दिखाना दम्भ है। अपनेको बड़ा मानना? श्रेष्ठ मानना मान है। हमारे पास इतनी विद्या? बुद्धि? योग्यता आदि है -- इस बातको लेकर नशासा आ जाना मद है। वे सदा दम्भ? मान और मदमें सने हुए रहते हैं? तदाकार रहते हैं।अशुचिव्रताः -- उनके व्रतनियम बड़े अपवित्र होते हैं जैसे -- इतने गाँवमें? इतने गायोंके बाड़ोंमें आग लगा देनी है इतने आदमियोंको मार देना है आदि। ये वर्ण? आश्रम? आचारशुद्धि आदि सब ढकोसलाबाजी है अतः किसीके भी साथ खाओपीओ। हम कथा आदि नहीं सुनेंगे हम तीर्थ? मन्दिर आदि स्थानोंमें नहीं जायँगे -- ऐसे उनके व्रतनियम होते हैं।ऐसे नियमोंवाले डाकू भी होते हैं। उनका यह नियम रहता है कि बिना मारपीट किये ही कोई वस्तु दे दे? तो वे लेंगे नहीं। जबतक चोट नहीं लगायेंगे? घावसे खून नहीं टपकेगा? तबतक हम उसकी वस्तु नहीं लेंगे? आदि।मोहाद् गृहीत्वासद्ग्राहान् -- मूढ़ताके कारण वे अनेक दुराग्रहोंको पकड़े रहते हैं। तामसी बुद्धिको लेकर चलना ही मूढ़ता है (गीता 18। 32)। वे शास्त्रोंकी? वेदोंकी? वर्णाश्रमोंकी और कुलपरम्पराकी मर्यादाको नहीं मानते? प्रत्युत इनके विपरीत चलनेमें? इनको भ्रष्ट करनेमें ही वे अपनी बहादुरी? अपना गौरव समझते हैं। वे अकर्तव्यको ही कर्तव्य और कर्तव्यको ही अकर्तव्य मानते हैं? हितको हि अहित और अहितको हि हित मानते हैं? ठीकको ही बेठीक और बेठीकको ही ठीक मानते हैं। इस असद्विचारोंके कारण उनकी बुद्धि इतनी गिर जाती है कि वे यह कहने लग जाते हैं कि मातापिताका हमारेपर कोई ऋण नहीं है। उनसे हमारा क्या सम्बन्ध है झूठ? कपट? जालसाजी करके भी धन कैसे बचे आदि उनके दुराग्रह होते हैं।, सम्बन्ध -- सत्कर्म? सद्भाव और सद्विचारोंके अभावमें उन आसुरी प्रकृतिवालोंके नियम? भाव और आचरण किस उद्देश्यको लेकर और किस प्रकारके होते हैं? अब उनको आगेके दो श्लोकोंमें बताते हैं।",

            "Devnagri": "जिस गर्व के साथ एक नितान्त भौतिकवादी व्यक्ति अपनी उपलब्धियों के क्षेत्र में विचरण करता है? उसके आन्तरिक स्वभाव की भयंकर विद्रूपता को? व्यासजी के द्वारा किये गये इस वर्णन से अधिक अच्छी प्रकार से व्यक्त नहीं किया जा सकता। आसुरी पुरुष की मनस्थिति तथा समाज में उसके कर्मों का स्तर का और अधिक स्पष्ट एवं सम्पूर्ण वर्णन पाने के लिए हमें विश्व की सभी भाषाओं के विद्यमान साहित्य में खोजबीन करनी होगी? फिर भी इस सारगर्भित श्लोक के समतुल्य चित्रण पाने में हमें असफलता ही मिलेगी।काममाश्रित्य इच्छाओं की प्रेरणा के बिना कर्म कदापि नहीं हो सकते हैं। इच्छाओं के अभाव में जीवन की उपलब्धियाँ असंभव है। तथापि? कामनाओं का शिकार बने रहने का अर्थ है कर्मों का कोई भयंकर यन्त्र बनना? जो जगत् में अहंकार और अहंकार केन्द्रित मनोद्वेगों के विष का वमन करता रहता है। कामनाओं की तृप्ति के लिए ही जीवन धारण करना अविवेक का लक्षण है क्योंकि? कामना का यह विशेष कौशल हैकि जैसेजैसे हम उसे तृप्त करते जाते हैं वैसेवैसे ही? वह द्विगुणित होती जाती है। उन्हें तृप्त करना कठिन है? वे दुष्पूर हैं। ऐसी कामनाओं से युक्त पुरुष जब अपने विवेक और सार्मथ्य का उपयोग करता है? तब स्वाभाविक है कि व्ाह अपने मन में तथा बाह्य जगत् में विक्षेप और दुर्व्यवस्था को उत्पन्न करता है।कामना क्या है विषयोपभोग के द्वारा शाश्वत सुख और सन्तोष को प्राप्त करने का जीव का प्रयत्न ही कामना है। जब वह इस प्रकार मोहित हो जाता है? तब वह दम्भ? मद और मान का भी शिकार बन जाता है। उनके द्वारा प्रताड़ित वह अपनी निरंकुश इच्छाओं को तृप्त करने के लिए सतत संघर्ष और परिश्रम करता रहता है।मोहात् परिपूर्ण और तृप्त पुरुष के मन में कामना नहीं हो सकती। जो पुरुष अपने अनन्त स्वरूप को न जानकर स्वयं को परिच्छिन्न जीव ही समझता है? केवल उसे ही विषयों की कामना हो सकती है। इसे ही मोह कहते हैं।असुर लोगों के मन का चरित्र इस श्लोक की द्वितीय पंक्ति में पूर्ण होता है। उन्हें यहाँ अशुचिव्रता कहा गया है। इसका अभिप्राय है कि ऐसे आसुरी स्वभाव के लोग येन केन प्रकारेण अपने ही सुख और शान्ति के लिए प्रयत्न करने में अन्य लोगों का कुछ भी महत्व नहीं समझते हैं। जीवन के सभी आदर्श मूल्यों को ताक में रखकर निर्लज्ज? असहिष्णु और क्रूर तक होकर वे अपने कार्यक्षेत्र में संघर्षरत रहते हैं। कामवासना से मदोन्मत्त और स्वार्थ से संवेदनाशून्य वह व्यक्ति जगत् में पागल के समान अपने चारों ओर रक्त और अम्ल फेंकता हुआ विपत्ति और विनाश का ही कार्य करता है एक व्यष्टि की दृष्टि से यह चित्र हमें एक ऐसे भोगवादी पुरुष को दर्शाता है? जो अपने जीवन का निर्माण कामना से विक्षुब्ध हुए मन की चंचल तरंगों पर करता है। समष्टि की दृष्टि से देखने पर यही शब्द चित्र हमें भौतिकवादी जनसमुदायों और राष्ट्रों की स्थिति का दर्शन कराता है। जीवन की सुन्दरता उस तत्त्वज्ञान की सुन्दरतापर निर्भर करती है? जिस पर जीवन का निर्माण होता है यदि नींव ही असत् हो? तो उसके ऊपर निर्मित ताश का महल अधिक सुदृढ़ नहीं हो सकता। यदि हम इस श्लोक को सूक्ष्मदृष्टि से देख सकें? तो ज्ञात होगा कि इसमें आज के जगत् में सर्वत्र अनुभव हो रहे आर्थिक विघटन? सामाजिक दोष? राजनीतिक उथलपुथल और अशान्ति का सम्पूर्ण विवेचन किया गया है।उपर्य़ुक्त वर्णन के द्वारा भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण अप्रत्यक्ष रूप से एक ऐसे भौतिकवादी पुरुष का चित्रण कर रहे हैं? जो अपने स्वभाव से ही नास्तिक विचारधारा का है तथा भोग के लिए ही कर्म करता है। क्या आज के भौतिकवादी युग में हम अपने को यथोक्त वर्णन के अनुरूप ही सिद्ध नहीं कर रहे हैं भगवान् आगे कहते हैं",

They have got the strong conviction that the sensual enjoyment is the highest end of a man. They are steeped in enjoying the objects of the senses. They firmly believe that that is everything. They believe that sensual enjoyment is the supreme source of happiness and there is no such thing as eternal bliss of the soul or transcendental bliss of the Self. They have no belief in the happiness in another world (or plane) or in the perennial bliss which is independent of sensual objects, which is beyond the reach of the senses.

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या -- चिन्तामपरिमेयां च प्रलयान्तामुपाश्रिताः -- आसुरीसम्पदावाले मनुष्योंमें ऐसी चिन्ताएँ रहती हैं? जिनका कोई मापतौल नहीं है। जबतक प्रलय अर्थात् मौत नहीं आती? तबतक उनकी चिन्ताएँ मिटती नहीं। ऐसी प्रलयतक रहनेवाली चिन्ताओंका फल भी प्रलयहीप्रलय अर्थात् बारबार मरना ही होता है।चिन्ताके दो विषय होते हैं -- एक पारमार्थिक और दूसरा सांसारिक। मेरा कल्याण? मेरा उद्धार कैसे हो परब्रह्म परमात्माका निश्चय कैसे हो (चिन्ता परब्रह्मविनिश्चयाय) इस प्रकार जिनको पारमार्थिक चिन्ता होती है? वे श्रेष्ठ हैं। परन्तु आसुरीसम्पदावालोंको ऐसी चिन्ता नहीं होती। वे तो इससे विपरीत सांसारिक चिन्ताओंके आश्रित रहते हैं कि हम कैसे जीयेंगे अपना जीवननिर्वाह कैसे करेंगे हमारे बिना बड़ेबूढ़े किसके आश्रित जीयेंगे हमारा मान? आदर? प्रतिष्ठा? इज्जत? प्रसिद्धि? नाम आदि कैसे बने रहेंगे मरनेके बाद हमारे बालबच्चोंकी क्या दशा होगी मर जायँगे तो धनसम्पत्ति? जमीनजायदादका क्या होगा धनके बिना हमारा काम कैसे चलेगा धनके बिना मकानकी मरम्मत कैसे होगी आदिआदि।मनुष्य व्यर्थमें ही चिन्ता करता है। निर्वाह तो होता रहेगा। निर्वाहकी चीजें तो बाकी रहेंगी और उनके रहते हुए ही मरेंगे। अपने पास एक लंगोटी रखनेवाले विरक्तसेविरक्तकी भी फटी लंगोटी और फूटी तूम्बी बाकी बचती है और मरता है पहले। ऐसे ही सभी व्यक्ति वस्तु आदिके रहते हुए ही मरते हैं। यह नियम नहीं है कि,धन पासमें होनेसे आदमी मरता न हो। धन पासमें रहतेरहते ही मनुष्य मर जाता है और धन पड़ा रहता है? काममें नहीं आता।एक बहुत बड़ा धनी आदमी था। उसने तिजोरीकी तरह लोहेका एक मजबूत मकान बना रखा था? जिसमें बहुत रत्न रखे हुए थे। उस मकानका दरवाजा ऐसा बना हुआ था? जो बंद होनेपर चाबीके बिना खुलता नहीं था। एक बार वह धनी आदमी बाहर चाबी छोड़कर उस मकानके भीतर चला गया और उसने भूलसे दरवाजा बंद कर लिया। अब चाबीके बिना दरवाना न खुलनेसे अन्न? जल? हवाके अभावमें मरते हुए उसने लिखा कि इतनी धनसम्पत्ति आज मेरे पास रहते हुए भी मैं मर रहा हूँ क्योंकि मुझे भीतर अन्नजल नहीं मिल रहा है? हवा नहीं मिल रही है ऐसे ही खाद्य पदार्थोंके रहनेसे नहीं मरेगा? यह भी नियम नहीं है। भोगोंके पासमें होते हुए भी ऐसे ही मरेगा। जैसे पेट आदिमें रोग लग जानेपर वैद्यडाक्टर उसको (अन्न पासमें रहते हुए भी) अन्न खाने नहीं देते? ऐसे ही मरना हो? तो पदार्थोंके रहते हुए भी मनुष्य मर जाता है।जो अपने पास एक कौड़ीका भी संग्रह नहीं करते? ऐसे विरक्त संतोंको भी प्रारब्धके अनुसार आवश्यकतासे अधिक चीजें मिल जाती हैं। अतः जीवननिर्वाह चीजोंके अधीन नहीं है (टिप्पणी प0 818)। परन्तु इस तत्त्वको आसुरी प्रकृतिवाले मनुष्य नहीं समझ सकते। वे तो यही समझते हैं कि हम चिन्ता करते हैं? कामना करते हैं? विचार करते हैं? उद्योग करते हैं? तभी चीजें मिलती हैं। यदि ऐसा न करें? तो भूखों मरना पड़े कामोपभोगपरमाः -- जो मनुष्य धनादि पदार्थोंका उपभोग करनेके परायण हैं? उनकी तो हरदम यही इच्छा रहती है कि सुखसामग्रीका खूब संग्रह कर लें और भोग भोग लें। उनको तो भोगोंके लिये धन चाहिये संसारमें बड़ा बननेके लिये धन चाहिये? सुखआराम? स्वादशौकीनी आदिके लिये धन चाहिये। तात्पर्य है कि उनके लिये भोगोंसे बढ़कर कुछ नहीं है।एतावदिति निश्चिताः -- उनका यह निश्चय होता है कि सुख भोगना और संग्रह करना -- इसके सिवाय और कुछ नहीं है (टिप्पणी प0 819.1)। इस संसारमें जो कुछ है? यही है। अतः उनकी दृष्टिमें परलोक एक ढकोसला है। उनकी मान्यता रहती है कि मरनेके बाद कहीं आनाजाना नहीं होता। बस? यहाँ शरीरके रहते हुए जितना सुख भोग लें? वही ठीक है क्योंकि मरनेपर तो शरीर यहीं बिखर जायगा (टिप्पणी प0 819.2)। शरीर स्थिर रहनेवाला है नहीं? आदिआदि भोगोंके निश्चयके सामने वे पापपुण्य? पुनर्जन्म आदिको भी नहीं मानते।",

            "Devnagri": "व्याख्या -- चिन्तामपरिमेयां च प्रलयान्तामुपाश्रिताः -- आसुरीसम्पदावाले मनुष्योंमें ऐसी चिन्ताएँ रहती हैं? जिनका कोई मापतौल नहीं है। जबतक प्रलय अर्थात् मौत नहीं आती? तबतक उनकी चिन्ताएँ मिटती नहीं। ऐसी प्रलयतक रहनेवाली चिन्ताओंका फल भी प्रलयहीप्रलय अर्थात् बारबार मरना ही होता है।चिन्ताके दो विषय होते हैं -- एक पारमार्थिक और दूसरा सांसारिक। मेरा कल्याण? मेरा उद्धार कैसे हो परब्रह्म परमात्माका निश्चय कैसे हो (चिन्ता परब्रह्मविनिश्चयाय) इस प्रकार जिनको पारमार्थिक चिन्ता होती है? वे श्रेष्ठ हैं। परन्तु आसुरीसम्पदावालोंको ऐसी चिन्ता नहीं होती। वे तो इससे विपरीत सांसारिक चिन्ताओंके आश्रित रहते हैं कि हम कैसे जीयेंगे अपना जीवननिर्वाह कैसे करेंगे हमारे बिना बड़ेबूढ़े किसके आश्रित जीयेंगे हमारा मान? आदर? प्रतिष्ठा? इज्जत? प्रसिद्धि? नाम आदि कैसे बने रहेंगे मरनेके बाद हमारे बालबच्चोंकी क्या दशा होगी मर जायँगे तो धनसम्पत्ति? जमीनजायदादका क्या होगा धनके बिना हमारा काम कैसे चलेगा धनके बिना मकानकी मरम्मत कैसे होगी आदिआदि।मनुष्य व्यर्थमें ही चिन्ता करता है। निर्वाह तो होता रहेगा। निर्वाहकी चीजें तो बाकी रहेंगी और उनके रहते हुए ही मरेंगे। अपने पास एक लंगोटी रखनेवाले विरक्तसेविरक्तकी भी फटी लंगोटी और फूटी तूम्बी बाकी बचती है और मरता है पहले। ऐसे ही सभी व्यक्ति वस्तु आदिके रहते हुए ही मरते हैं। यह नियम नहीं है कि,धन पासमें होनेसे आदमी मरता न हो। धन पासमें रहतेरहते ही मनुष्य मर जाता है और धन पड़ा रहता है? काममें नहीं आता।एक बहुत बड़ा धनी आदमी था। उसने तिजोरीकी तरह लोहेका एक मजबूत मकान बना रखा था? जिसमें बहुत रत्न रखे हुए थे। उस मकानका दरवाजा ऐसा बना हुआ था? जो बंद होनेपर चाबीके बिना खुलता नहीं था। एक बार वह धनी आदमी बाहर चाबी छोड़कर उस मकानके भीतर चला गया और उसने भूलसे दरवाजा बंद कर लिया। अब चाबीके बिना दरवाना न खुलनेसे अन्न? जल? हवाके अभावमें मरते हुए उसने लिखा कि इतनी धनसम्पत्ति आज मेरे पास रहते हुए भी मैं मर रहा हूँ क्योंकि मुझे भीतर अन्नजल नहीं मिल रहा है? हवा नहीं मिल रही है ऐसे ही खाद्य पदार्थोंके रहनेसे नहीं मरेगा? यह भी नियम नहीं है। भोगोंके पासमें होते हुए भी ऐसे ही मरेगा। जैसे पेट आदिमें रोग लग जानेपर वैद्यडाक्टर उसको (अन्न पासमें रहते हुए भी) अन्न खाने नहीं देते? ऐसे ही मरना हो? तो पदार्थोंके रहते हुए भी मनुष्य मर जाता है।जो अपने पास एक कौड़ीका भी संग्रह नहीं करते? ऐसे विरक्त संतोंको भी प्रारब्धके अनुसार आवश्यकतासे अधिक चीजें मिल जाती हैं। अतः जीवननिर्वाह चीजोंके अधीन नहीं है (टिप्पणी प0 818)। परन्तु इस तत्त्वको आसुरी प्रकृतिवाले मनुष्य नहीं समझ सकते। वे तो यही समझते हैं कि हम चिन्ता करते हैं? कामना करते हैं? विचार करते हैं? उद्योग करते हैं? तभी चीजें मिलती हैं। यदि ऐसा न करें? तो भूखों मरना पड़े कामोपभोगपरमाः -- जो मनुष्य धनादि पदार्थोंका उपभोग करनेके परायण हैं? उनकी तो हरदम यही इच्छा रहती है कि सुखसामग्रीका खूब संग्रह कर लें और भोग भोग लें। उनको तो भोगोंके लिये धन चाहिये संसारमें बड़ा बननेके लिये धन चाहिये? सुखआराम? स्वादशौकीनी आदिके लिये धन चाहिये। तात्पर्य है कि उनके लिये भोगोंसे बढ़कर कुछ नहीं है।एतावदिति निश्चिताः -- उनका यह निश्चय होता है कि सुख भोगना और संग्रह करना -- इसके सिवाय और कुछ नहीं है (टिप्पणी प0 819.1)। इस संसारमें जो कुछ है? यही है। अतः उनकी दृष्टिमें परलोक एक ढकोसला है। उनकी मान्यता रहती है कि मरनेके बाद कहीं आनाजाना नहीं होता। बस? यहाँ शरीरके रहते हुए जितना सुख भोग लें? वही ठीक है क्योंकि मरनेपर तो शरीर यहीं बिखर जायगा (टिप्पणी प0 819.2)। शरीर स्थिर रहनेवाला है नहीं? आदिआदि भोगोंके निश्चयके सामने वे पापपुण्य? पुनर्जन्म आदिको भी नहीं मानते।",

            "Hindi": "चिन्ता और व्याकुलता से ग्रस्त ये हतोत्साहित लोग अपने निरर्थक उद्यमों के जीवन को दुख के गलियारे से खींचते हुए मृत्यु के आंगन में ले आते हैं। सामान्य जीवन में? ये चिन्ताएं शान्ति और आनन्द के दुर्ग पर टूट पड़ती हैं और विशेष रूप से तब? जब शक्तिशाली कामनाओं ने मनुष्य को जीतकर अपने वश में कर लिया होता है। अपनी इष्ट वस्तुओं को प्राप्त करने (योग) के लिए परिश्रम और संघर्ष तथा प्राप्त की गयी वस्तुओं के रक्षण (क्षेम) की व्याकुलता? यही मनुष्य जीवन की चिन्ताएं होती हैं। जीवन पर्यन्त की कालावधि केवल इन्हीं चिन्ताओं में अपव्यय करना और अन्त में? यही पाना कि हम उसमें कितने दयनीय रूप से विफल हुए हैं? वास्तव में एक बड़ी त्रासदी है।कामोपभोगपरमा सत्कार्य के क्षेत्र में हो या दुष्कृत्य के क्षेत्र में? मनुष्य को निरन्तर कार्यरत रहने के लिए किसी दर्शन (जीवन विषयक दृष्टिकोण) की आवश्यकता होती है? जिसके बिना उसके प्रयत्न असंबद्ध? हीनस्तर के और निरर्थक होते हैं।आसुरी स्वभाव के लोगों का जीवनदर्शन निरपवादरूप से सर्वत्र एक समान ही होता है। इस श्लोक में चार्वाक मत (नास्तिक दर्शन) को इंगित किया गया है। इस मत के अनुसार काम ही मनुष्य जीवन का परम पुरषार्थ है? अन्य धर्म या मोक्ष कुछ नहीं।इतना ही है सामान्यत? ये भौतिकतावादी मूर्ख नहीं होते? परन्तु वे अत्यन्त स्थूल बुद्धि और सतही दृष्टि से विचार करते हैं। वे यह अनुभव करते हैं कि केवल विषय भोग का जीवन दुखपूर्ण होता है? और इसमें क्षुद्र लाभ के लिये मनुष्य को अत्यधिक मूल्य चुकाना पड़ता है। फिर भी? वे अपनी अनियंत्रित कामवासना को ही तृप्त करने में रत और व्यस्त रहते हैं। उनसे यदि इस विषय में प्रश्न पूछा जाये? तो उनका उत्तर होगा कि यह संघर्ष ही जीवन है। वह सुख और शान्तिमय जीवन को जानते ही नहीं है। वे प्राय निराशावादी होते हैं और नैतिक दृष्टि से जीवन विषयक गंभीर विचार करने से कतराते हैं। फलत उनमें आत्महत्या और नर हत्या की प्रवृत्तियाँ भी देखी जा सकती हैं। उनकी धारणा यह होती है कि चिन्ता और दुख से ही जीवन की रचना हुई है। जीवन के सतही असामञ्जस्य और विषमताओं के पीछे जो सामञ्जस्य और लय है? उसे वह पहचान नहीं पाते। भविष्य में कोई आशा की किरण न देखकर उनका हृदय कटुता से भर जाता है और फिर उनका जीवन मात्र प्रतिशोधपूर्ण हो जाता है। निष्फल परिश्रम में वे अपनी शक्तियों का अपव्यय करते हैं और अन्त में थके? हारे और निराश होकर दयनीय मृत्यु को प्राप्त होते हैं।उपर्युक्त जीवन दर्शन की अभिव्यक्ति को अगले श्लोक में बताते हुये भगवान् कहते हैं",

          "Shankaracharya (English)": "Baddhah, bound, being impelled, being lured from all sides; asa-pasa-sataih, by hundreds of shackles in the from of hope-the hopes themselves are the shackles; by hundreds of these; kama-krodha-parayanah, giving themselves wholly to passion and anger, having passion and anger as their highest resort; ihante, they endeavour; artha-sancayan, to amass wealth; anyayena, through foul means, i.e. by stealing others' wealth, etc.; kama-bhoga-artham, for the enjoyment of desirable objects-in order to enjoy desirable objects, not for righteous acts. Their intentions, too, are of this kind:",
          "Ramanujacharya (Sanskrit)": "आशापाशशतैः आशाख्यपाशशतैः बद्धाः कामक्रोधपरायणाः कामक्रोधैकनिष्ठाः। कामभोगार्थम् अन्यायेन अर्थसंचयान् प्रति ईहन्ते।",
          "Ramanujacharya (English)": "They are 'bound by hundreds of fetters of hope,' viz., bound by hundreds of fetters in the form of hope. They are given over to 'desire and anger,' viz., they are intent solely on desire and anger. To satisfy their sensual desires, they endeavour for wealth through immortal means.",

            "English": "आशापाशशतैः by a hundred ties of hope, बद्धाः bound, कामक्रोधपरायणाः given over to lust and anger, ईहन्ते (they) strive (to attain), कामभोगार्थम् for sensual enjoyment, अन्यायेन by unlawful means, अर्थसञ्चयान् hoards of wealth.Commentary: They murder people and rob them of their wealth in order to have sensual enjoyments. They amass wealth for sensepleasure only, but not for doing righteous actions. They have no mercy. They are very cruel. They are held in bondage by a hundred ties of expectation. They harbour in their hearts a craving for all kinds of sensual objects. Various sorts of desires crop up in their mind. When their desires are not gratified they become furious. They acire wealth by unjust means. Hope or expectation binds a man to the wheel of Samsara.,Therefore hope is likened to a cord or a rope. There is no end to their cravings. Though they possess enormous wealth their cravings are not appeased. They multiply daily. These people become hopeless victims of greed."

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या -- आशापाशशतैर्बद्धाः -- आसुरी सम्पत्तिवाले मनुष्य आशारूपी सैकड़ों पाशोंसे बँधे रहते हैं अर्थात् उनको इतना धन हो जायगा? इतना मान हो जायगा? शरीरमें नीरोगता आ जायगी आदि सैकड़ों आशाओंकी फाँसियाँ लगी रहती हैं। आशाकी फाँसीसे बँधे हुए मनुष्योंके पास लाखोंकरोड़ों रुपये हो जायँ? तो भी उनका मँगतापन नहीं मिटता उनकी तो यही आशा रहती है कि सन्तोंसे कुछ मिल जाय? भगवान्से कुछ मिल जाय? मनुष्योंसे कुछ मिल जाय। इतना ही नहीं पशुपक्षी? वृक्षलता? पहाड़समुद्र आदिसे भी हमें कुछ मिल जाय। इस प्रकार उनमें सदा खाऊँखाऊँ बनी रहती है। ऐसे व्यक्तियोंकी सांसारिक आशाएँ कभी पूरी नहीं होतीं (गीता 9। 12)। यदि पूरी हो भी जायँ? तो भी कुछ फायदा नहीं है क्योंकि यदि वे जीते रहेंगे? तो आशावाली वस्तु नष्ट हो जायगी और आशावाली वस्तु रहेगी? तो वे मर जायँगे अथवा दोनों ही नष्ट हो जायँगे।जो आशारूपी फाँसीसे बँधे हुए हैं? वे कभी एक जगह स्थिर नहीं रह सकते और जो इस आशारूपी फाँसीसे छूट गये हैं? वे मौजसे एक जगह रहते हैं -- आशा नाम मनुष्याणां काचिदाश्चर्यश्रृङ्खला। यया बद्धाः प्रधावन्ति मुक्तास्तिष्ठन्ति पङ्गुवत्।।कामक्रोधपरायणाः -- उनका परम अयन? स्थान काम और क्रोध ही होते हैं (टिप्पणी प0 819.3) अर्थात् अपनी कामनापूर्तिके करनेके लिये और क्रोधपूर्वक दूसरोंको कष्ट देनेके लिये ही उनका जीवन होता है। कामक्रोधके परायण मनुष्योंका यह निश्चय रहता है कि कामनाके बिना मनुष्य जड हो जाता है। क्रोधके बिना उसका तेज भी नहीं रहता। कामनासे ही सब काम होता है? नहीं तो आदमी काम करे ही क्यों कामनाके बिना तो आदमीका जीवन ही भार हो जायगा। संसारमें काम और क्रोध ही तो सार चीज है। इसके बिना लोग हमें संसारमें रहने ही नहीं देंगे। क्रोधसे ही शासन चलता है? नहीं तो शासनको मानेगा ही कौन क्रोधसे दबाकर दूसरोंको ठीक करना चाहिये? नहीं तो लोग हमारा सर्वस्व छीन लेंगे। फिर तो हमारा अपना कुछ अस्तित्व ही नहीं रहेगा? आदि।ईहन्ते कामभोगार्थमन्यायेनार्थसंचयान् -- आसुरी प्रकृतिवाले मनुष्योंका उद्देश्य धनका संग्रह करना और विषयोंका भोग करना होता है। इस उद्देश्यकी पूर्तिके लिये वे बेईमानी? धोखेबाजी? विश्वासघात? टैक्सकी चोरी आदि करके दूसरोंका हक मारकर मन्दिर? बालक? विधवा आदिका धन दबाकर और इस तरह अनेक अन्यान्य पाप करके धनका संचय करना चाहते हैं। कारण कि उनके मनमें यह बात गहराईसे बैठी रहती है कि आजकलके जमानेमें ईमानदारीसे? न्यायसे कोई धनी थोड़े ही हो सकता है ये जितने धनी हुए हैं? सब अन्याय? चोरी? धोखेबाजी करके ही हुए हैं। ईमानदारीसे? न्यायसे काम करनेकी जो बात है? वह तो कहनेमात्रकी है काममें नहीं आ सकती। यदि हम न्यायके अनुसार काम करेंगे? तो हमें दुःख पाना पड़ेगा और जीवनधारण करना मुश्किल हो जायगा। ऐसा उन आसुर स्वभाववाले व्यक्तियोंका निश्चय होता है।जो व्यक्ति न्यायपूर्वक स्वर्गके भोगोंकी प्राप्तिके लिये लगे हुए हैं उनके लिये भी भगवान्ने कहा है कि उन लोगोंकी बुद्धिमें हमें परमात्माकी प्राप्ति करना है यह निश्चय हो ही नहीं सकता (गीता 2। 44)। फिर जो अन्यायपूर्वक धन कमाकर प्राणोंके पोषणमें लगे हुए हैं? उनकी बुद्धिमें परमात्मप्राप्तिका निश्चय कैसे हो सकता है परन्तु वे भी यदि चाहें तो परमात्मप्राप्तिका निश्चय करके साधनपरायण हो सकते हैं। ऐसा निश्चय करनेके लिये किसीको भी मना नहीं है क्योंकि मनुष्यजन्म परमात्मप्राप्तिके लिये ही मिला है। सम्बन्ध -- आसुर स्वभाववाले व्यक्ति लोभ? क्रोध और अभिमानको लेकर किस प्रकारके मनोरथ किया करते हैं? उसे क्रमशः आगेके तीन श्लोकोंमें बताते हैं।",

[Vaitarani: It is the most terrible place of punishment; a river filled with all kinds of filth-blood, hair, bones etc., and running with great impetuosity, hot and fetid.

In this way they are ensnared by the net of delusion. Highly addicted to sensual enjoyments, they die in the middle of such enjoyments and fall into foul Naraka [Naraka is sometimes translated as hell. This is the Christian conception.

Delusion is a snare because those who are deluded are entrapped. They are caught like fish in the meshes of the net of delusion. They are enveloped by the net on four sides. They are bewildered as to what to do first and what next. As they are enveloped or covered by delusion, they are bewildered in various ways by entertaining various evil thoughts. They have no discrimination between the proper or beneficial and improper or harmful Sadhanas. The lack of the knowledge of the distinction between these two is Moha. As Mohas is a veil and a cause of bondage it is compared to a net.All the alities mentioned above lead to downfall."

They esteem themselves very highly. They are not esteemed or honoured as such by the righteous or pious persons. They have a very high opinion of their own greatness. They esteem themselves as possessed of all the virtuous attributes. They are not humble. They have no humility or meekness. Their minds are entirely filled with a sense of their own importance. They treat others with contempt. They think that others are inferior to them. They never bend their heads and make prostrations to elders or superiors or spiritual teachers and monks. They stand erect like a pillar or iron post, intoxicated as they are with the wine of wealth. They pretend to perform Yajnas.They do not care for an altar, a sacrifical bower or a receptacle for the fire, or any of the proper materials to be used in the sacrifices. They do not pay any attention to the prescribed rules. They do sacrifices in order to increase their own fame. They will not hear even the mentioning of the name of God or Brahmana. How can God or a Brahmana attend their sacrifices They perform sacrifices without paying attention to the several parts of them and the obligations enjoined in the scriptural ordinances such as the recitation of the Mantras, worship of the gods, giving of the fees, etc. They will not do the sacrifices with reverence and faith. They want that all the people should say that they are Somayajis (performers of the Soma sacrifice). They will not attain the fruits of the sacrifice. There is no idea of service in them. They perform sacrifice to deceive the world, but not out of sincerity and faith.Mana Pride consists in supposing oneself worthy of a high honour (on account of ones wealth or learning, etc.).Mada On account of intoxication of wealth the wealthy man treats the Guru and other persons who are worthy of being honoured, with contempt. Wealth and learning turn their heads. This is Mada."

            "Devnagri": "व्याख्या -- आत्मसम्भाविताः -- वे धन? मान? बड़ाई? आदर आदिकी दृष्टिसे अपने मनसे ही अपनेआपको बड़ा मानते हैं? पूज्य समझते हैं कि हमारे समान कोई नहीं है अतः हमारा पूजन होना चाहिये? हमारा आदर होना चाहिये? हमारी प्रशंसा होनी चाहिये। वर्ण? आश्रम? विद्या? बुद्धि? पद? अधिकार? योग्यता आदिमें हम सब तरहसे श्रेष्ठ हैं अतः सब लोगोंको हमारे अनुकूल चलना चाहिये।स्तब्धाः -- वे किसीके सामने नम्र नहीं होते? नमते नहीं। कोई सन्तमहात्मा या अवतारी भगवान् ही सामने क्यों न आ जायँ? तो भी वे उनको नमस्कार नहीं करेंगे। वे तो अपनेआपको ही ऊँचा समझते हैं? फिर किसके सामने नम्रता करें और किसको नमस्कार करें कहीं किसी कारणसे परवश होकर लोगोंके सामने झुकना भी पड़े? तो अभिमानसहित ही झुकेंगे। इस प्रकार उनमें बहुत ज्यादा ऐंठअकड़ रहती है।धनमानमदान्विताः -- वे धन और मानके मदसे सदा चूर रहते हैं। उनमें धनका? अपने जनोंका? जमीनजायदाद और मकान आदिका मद (नशा) होता है। इधरउधर पहचान हो जाती है? तो उसका भी उनके मनमें मद होता है कि हमारी तो बड़ेबड़े मिनिस्टरोंतक पहचान है। हमारे पास ऐसी शक्ति है? जिससे चाहे जो प्राप्त कर सकते हैं और चाहे जिसका नाश कर सकते हैं। इस प्रकार धन और मान ही उनका सहारा होता है। इनका ही उन्हें नशा होता है? गरमी होती है। अतः वे इनको ही श्रेष्ठ मानते हैं।यजन्ते नामयज्ञैस्ते दम्भेन -- वे लोग (पन्द्रहवें श्लोकमें आये यक्ष्ये दास्यामि पदोंके अनुसार) दम्भपूर्वक नाममात्रके यज्ञ करते हैं। वे केवल लोगोंको दिखानेके लिये और अपनी महिमाके लिये ही यज्ञ करते हैं? तथा इस भावसे करते हैं कि दूसरोंपर असर पड़ जाय और वे हमारे प्रभावसे प्रभावित हो जायँ उनकी आँख खुल जाय कि हम क्या हैं? उन्हें चेत हो जाय आदि।लोगोंमें हमारा नाम हो जाय? प्रसिद्धि हो जाय? आदर हो जाय -- इसके लिये वे यज्ञके नामपर अपने नामका खूब प्रचार करेंगे? अपने नामका छापा (पैम्फलेट) छपवायेंगे। ब्राह्मणोंके लिये भोजन करेंगे? तो खीरमें कपूर डाल देंगे? जिससे वे अधिक न खा सकें क्योंकि उससे खर्चा भी अधिक नहीं होगा और नाम भी हो जायगा। ऐसे ही पंक्तिमें भोजनके लिये दोदो? चारचार? पाँचपाँच सकोरे और पत्तलें एक साथ परोस देंगे? जिससे उन सकोरे और पत्तलेंको बाहर फेंकनेपर उनका ढेर लग जाय और लोगोंको यह पता चल जाय कि ये कितने अच्छे व्यक्ति हैं? जिन्होंने इतने ब्राह्मणोंको भोजन कराया है। इस प्रकार ये आसुरीसम्पदावालोंके भीतर भाव होते हैं और भावोंके अनुसार ही उनके आचरण होते हैं।आसुरीसम्पत्तिवाले व्यक्ति शास्त्रोक्त यज्ञ? दान? पूजन आदि कर्म तो करते हैं और उनके लिये पैसे भी खर्च करते हैं? पर करते हैं शास्त्रविधिकी परवाह न करके और दम्भपूर्वक ही।मन्दिरोंमें जब कोई मेलामहोत्सव हो और ज्यादा लोगोंके आनेकी उम्मीद हो तथा बड़ेबड़े धनी लोग आनेवाले हों? तब मन्दिरको अच्छी तरह सजायेंगे? ठाकुरजीको खूब बढ़ियाबढ़िया गहनेकपड़े पहनायेंगे? जिससे ज्यादा लोग आ जायँ और खूब भेंटचढ़ावा इकट्ठा हो जाय। इस प्रकार ठाकुरजीका तो नाममात्रका पूजन होता है? पर वास्तवमें पूजन होता है लोगोंका। ऐसे ही कोई मिनिस्टर या अफसर आनेवाला हो? तो उनको राजी करनेके लिये ठाकुरजीको खूब सजायेंगे और जब वे मन्दिरमें आयेंगे? तब उनका खूब आदरसत्कार करेंगे? उनको ठाकुरजीकी माला देंगे? प्रसाद (जो उनके लिये विशेषरूपसे तैयार रखा रहता है) देंगे? इसलिये कि वे राजी हो जायँगे? तो हमारे व्यापारमें? घरेलू कामोंमें हमारी सहायता करेंगे? मुकदमे आदिमें हमारा पक्ष लेंगे? आदि। इन भावोंसे वे ठाकुरजीका जो पूजन करते हैं? वह तो नाममात्रका पूजन है। वास्तवमें पूजन होता है -- अपने व्यापारका? घरेलू कामोंका? लड़ाईझगड़ोंका क्योंकि उनका उद्देश्य ही वही है।गौसेवीसंस्थासंचालक भी गोशालाओंमें प्रायः दूध देनेवाली स्वस्थ गायोंको ही रखेंगे और उनको अधिक चारा देंगे पर लूलीलँगड़ी? अपाहिज? अन्धी और दूध न देनेवाली गायोंको नहीं रखेंगे? तथा किसीको रखेंगे भी तो उसको दूध देनेवाली गायोंकी अपेक्षा बहुत कम चारा देंगे। परन्तु हमारी गोशालामें कितना गोपालन हो रहा है? इसकी असलियतकी तरफ खयाल न करके केवल लोगोंको दिखानेके लिये उसका झूठा प्रचार करेंगे। छापा? लेख? विज्ञापन? पुस्तिका आदि छपवाकर बाँटेंगे? जिससे पैसा तो अधिकसेअधिक आये? पर खर्चा कमसेकम हो।धार्मिक संस्थाओँमें भी जो संचालक कहलाते हैं? वे प्रायः उन धार्मिक संस्थाओंके पैसोंसे अपने घरका काम चलायेंगे। अपनेको नफा किस प्रकार हो? हमारी दूकान किस तरह चले? पैसे कैसे मिलें -- इस प्रकार अपने स्वार्थको लेकर केवल दिखावटीपनसे सारा काम करेंगे।प्रायः साधनभजन करनेवाले भी दूसरेको आता देखकर आसन लगाकर बैठ जायँगे? भजनध्यान करने लग जायँगे? माला घुमाने लग जायँगे। परन्तु कोई देखनेवाला न हो तो बातचीतमें लग जायँगे? ताशचौपड़ खेलेंगे अथवा सो जायँगे। ऐसा जो साधनभजन होता है? वह केवल इसलिये कि दूसरे मुझे अच्छा मानें? भक्त मानें और मेरी प्रशंसा करें? मेरा आदरसम्मान करें? मुझे पैसे मिलें? लोगोंमें मेरा नाम हो जाय? आदि। इस प्रकार यह साधनभजन भगवान्का तो नाममात्रके लिये होता है? पर वास्तवमें साधनभजन होता है अपने नामका? अपने शरीरका? पैसोंका। इस प्रकार आसुरी प्रकृतिवालोंके विषयमें कहाँतक कहा जायअविधिपूर्वकम् -- वे आसुर मनुष्य शास्त्रविधिको तो मानते ही नहीं? सदा शास्त्रनिषिद्ध काम करते हैं। वे यज्ञ? दान आदि तो करेंगे? पर उनको विधिपूर्वक नहीं करेंगे। दान करेंगे तो सुपात्रको न देकर कुपात्रको देंगे। कुपात्रोंके साथ ही एकता रखेंगे। इस प्रकार उलटेउलटे काम करेंगे। बुद्धि सर्वथा विपरीत होनेके कारण उनको उलटी बात भी सुलटी ही दीखती है -- सर्वार्थान् विपरीतांश्च (गीता 18। 32)।",

It is very difficult to overcome this dire enemy, but through Vichara (right eniry) it can be annihilated.These Asuras who are very egoistic on account of their deep ignorance esteem themselves very highly for the alities they possess and for those which they falsely superimpose upon themselves. They think that they are very great persons on account of the good alities which they have superimposed upon themselves and their egoism is increased thery. They try to humiliate others by using their financial supremacy. They will bribe people to give false evidence and do anything to attain their selfish ends.Balam Power accompanied by lust and attachment. The Asuras use their strength of body to humiliate and destroy others. If a man is not established in Yama (the fivefold canon of ethical perfection, consisting of noninjury, truthfulness, nonstealing, celibacy and noncovetousness), if he has no purity of heart, if his mind is surcharged or saturated with evil tendencies, and if he gets power of any sort, he will misuse or abuse it and try to humiliate or abuse others. Powers or Siddhis are bound to come if one practises concentration of mind. If he is endowed with Yama, he will never misuse them and so he will never have a downfall. That is the reason why Patanjali Maharshi says Powers are obstacles on the path of Yoga. Shun them ruthlessly. March onwards to the goal. Climb the ladder of Yoga till you attain the highest state of superconsciousness or Godconsciousness. Do not look back. Have no memories of the past.Yama is the very foundation of Yoga. Get yourself established in Yama before you take to concentration and meditation. Many aspirants get a downfall because they do not practise Yama to begin with. They jump at once to the practice of concentration and meditation. This is sad mistake.Darpa Haughtiness. A man whose heart is filled with haughtiness becomes very insolent and unjust and assumes an overbearing and domineering attitude towards others he never respects the elders, Gurus and others. This is a peculiar vice that has its seat in the mind. When this evil ality manifests itself, one swerves from the path of virtue.Krodha Anger manifests itself when one gets something unplesant and when he comes across something disagreeable.These Asuras hate Me, the Lord Who dwells in their own bodies as the silent witness of their thoughts and actions. They think that I am also a human being and hate Me. They do not understand My allpervading and imperishable nature. They do not care at all to know and follow. My commands or the injunctions given in the Vedas and the Smritis. If anyone violates My commands given in the scriptures, it is surely tantamount to an act of hatred towards Me. These people are very malicious. They have evil intentions or impure motives. They are jealous of those persons who are virtuous and who tread the path of righteousness. Their hearts burn when they notice good alities in others. This is Matsarya, a form of jealousy. If a man superimposes evil alities on a virtuous man who is endowed with good alities, this is Asuya. If his heart burns when he sees a wealthy or prosperous man, this is Irshya."

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या -- आसुरीं योनिमापन्ना ৷৷. मामप्राप्यैव कौन्तेय -- पीछेके श्लोकमें भगवान्ने आसुर मनुष्योंको बारबार पशुपक्षी आदिकी योनियोंमें गिरानेकी बात कही। अब उसी बातको लेकर भगवान् यहाँ कहते हैं कि मनुष्यजन्ममें मुझे प्राप्त करनेका दुर्लभ अवसर पाकर भी वे आसुर मनुष्य मेरी प्राप्ति न करके पशु? पक्षी आदि आसुरी योनियोंमें चले जाते हैं और बारबार उन आसुरी योनियोंमें ही जन्म लेते रहते हैं।मामप्राप्यैव पदसे भगवान् पश्चात्तापके साथ कहते हैं कि अत्यन्त कृपा करके मैंने जीवोंको मनुष्यशरीर देकर इन्हें अपना उद्धार करनेका मौका दिया और यह विश्वास किया कि ये अपना उद्धार अवश्य कर लेंगे परन्ते ये नराधम इतने मूढ़ और विश्वासघाती निकले कि जिस शरीरसे मेरी प्राप्ति करनी थी? उससे मेरी प्राप्ति न करके उलटे अधम गतिको चले गये मनुष्यशरीर प्राप्त हो जानेके बाद वह कैसा ही आचरणवाला क्यों न हो अर्थात् दुराचारीसेदुराचारी क्यों न हो? वह भी यदि चाहे तो थो़ड़ेसेथोड़े समयमें (गीता 9। 30 -- 31) और जीवनके अन्तकालमें (गीता 8। 5) भी भगवान्को प्राप्त कर सकता है। कारण कि समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु (गीता 9। 29) कहकर भगवान्ने अपनी प्राप्ति सबके लिये अर्थात् प्राणिमात्रके लिये खुली रखी है। हाँ? यह बात हो सकती है कि पशुपक्षी,आदिमें उनको प्राप्त करनेकी योग्यता नहीं है परन्तु भगवान्की तरफसे तो किसीके लिये भी मना नहीं है। ऐसा अवसर सर्वथा प्राप्त हो जानेपर भी ये आसुर मनुष्य भगवान्को प्राप्त न करके अधम गतिमें चले जाते हैं? तो इनकी इस दुर्गतिको देखकर परम दयालु प्रभु दुःखी होते हैं।ततो यान्त्यधमां गतिम् -- आसुरी योनियोंमें जानेपर भी उनके सभी पाप पूरे नष्ट नहीं होते। अतः उन बचे हुए पापोंको भोगनेके लिये वे उन आसुरी योनियोंसे भी भयङ्कर अधम गतिको अर्थात् नरकोंको प्राप्त होते हैं।यहाँ शङ्का हो सकती है कि आसुरी योनियोंको प्राप्त हुए मनुष्योंको तो उन योनियोंमें भगवान्को प्राप्त करनेका अवसर ही नहीं है और उनमें वह योग्यता भी नहीं है? फिर भगवान्ने ऐसा क्यों कहा कि वे मेरेको प्राप्त न करके उससे भी अधम गतिमें चले जाते हैं इसका समाधान यह है कि भगवान्का ऐसा कहना आसुरी योनियोंको प्राप्त होनेसे पूर्व मनुष्यशरीरको लेकर ही है। तात्पर्य है कि मनुष्यशरीरको पाकर? मेरी प्राप्तिका अधिकार पाकर भी वे मनुष्य मेरी प्राप्ति न करके जन्मजन्मान्तरमें आसुरी योनियोंको प्राप्त होते हैं। इतना ही नहीं? वे उन आसुरी योनियोंसे भी नीचे कुम्भीपाक आदि घोर नरकोंमें चले जाते हैं। विशेष बात भगवत्प्राप्तिके अथवा कल्याणके उद्देश्यसे दिये गये मनुष्यशरीरको पाकर भी मनुष्य कामना? स्वार्थ एवं अभिमानके वशीभूत होकर चोरीडकैती? झूठकपट? धोखा? विश्वासघात? हिंसा आदि जिन कर्मोंको करते हैं? उनके दो परिणाम होते हैं -- (1) बाहरी फलअंश और (2) भीतरी संस्कारअंश। दूसरोंको दुःख देनेपर उनका (जिनको दुःख दिया गया है) तो वही नुकसान होता है? जो प्रारब्धसे होनेवाला है परन्तु जो दुःख देते हैं? वे नया पाप करते हैं? जिसका फल नरक उन्हें भोगना ही पड़ता है। इतना ही नहीं? दुराचारोंके द्वारा जो नये पाप होनेके बीज बोये जाते हैं अर्थात् उन दुराचारोंके द्वारा अहंतामें जो दुर्भाव बैठ जाते हैं? उनसे मनुष्यका बहुत भयंकर नुकसान होता है। जैसे? चोरीरूप कर्म करनेसे पहले मनुष्य स्वयं चोर बनता है क्योंकि वह चोर बनकर ही चोरी करेगा और चोरी करनेसे अपनेमें (अहंतामें) चोरका भाव दृढ़ हो जायगा (टिप्पणी प0 827.1)। इस प्रकार चोरीके संस्कार उसकी अहंतामें बैठ जाते हैं। ये संस्कार मनुष्यका बड़ा भारी पतन करते हैं -- उससे बारबार चोरीरूप पाप करवाते है और फलस्वरूप नरकोंमें ले जाते हैं। अतः जबतक वह मनुष्य अपना कल्याण नहीं कर लेता अर्थात् जबतक वह अपनी अहंतामें बैठाये हुए दुर्भावोंको नहीं मिटाता? तबतक वे दुर्भाव जन्मजन्मान्तरतक दुराचारोंको बल देते रहेंगे? उकसाते रहेंगे और उनके कारण वे आसुरी योनियोंमें तथा उससे भी भयङ्कर नरक आदिमें दुःख? सन्ताप? आफत आदि पाते ही रहेंगे। उन आसुरी योनियोंमें भी उनकी प्रकृति और प्रवृत्तिके अनुसार यह देखा जाता है कि कई पशुपक्षी? भूतपिशाच? कीटपतंग आदि सौम्यप्रकृतिप्रधान होते हैं और कई क्रूरप्रकृतिप्रधान होते हैं। इस तरह उनकी प्रकृति(स्वभाव) में भेद उनकी अपनी बनायी हुई शुद्ध या अशुद्ध अहंताके कारण ही होते हैं। अतः उन योनियोंमें अपनेअपने कर्मोंका फलभोग होनेपर भी उनकी प्रकृतिके भेद वैसे ही बने रहते हैं। इतना ही नहीं सम्पूर्ण योनियोंको और नरकोंको भोगनेके बाद किसी क्रमसे अथवा भगवत्कृपासे उनको मनुष्यशरीर प्राप्त हो भी जाता है? तो भी उनकी अहंतामें बैठे हुए कामक्रोधादि दुर्भाव पहलेजैसे ही रहते हैं (टिप्पणी प0 827.2)। इसी प्रकार जो स्वर्गप्राप्तिकी कामनासे यहाँ शुभ कर्म करते हैं? और मरनेके बाद उन कर्मोंके अनुसार स्वर्गमें जाते हैं? वहाँ उनके कर्मोंका फलभोग तो हो जाता है? पर उनके स्वभावका परिवर्तन नहीं होता अर्थात् उनकी अहंतामें परिवर्तन नहीं होता (टिप्पणी प0 827.3)। स्वभावको बदलनेका? शुद्ध बनानेका मौका तो मनुष्यशरीरमें ही है। सम्बन्ध -- पूर्वश्लोकमें भगवान्ने कहा कि ये जीव मनुष्यशरीरमें मेरी प्राप्तिका अवसर पाकर भी मुझे प्राप्त नहीं करते? जिससे मुझे उनको अधम योनिमें भेजना पड़ता है। उनका अधम योनिमें और अधम गति(नरक) में जानेका मूल कारण क्या है -- इसको भगवान् आगेके श्लोकमें बताते हैं।",

            "Devnagri": "व्याख्या -- आसुरीं योनिमापन्ना ৷৷. मामप्राप्यैव कौन्तेय -- पीछेके श्लोकमें भगवान्ने आसुर मनुष्योंको बारबार पशुपक्षी आदिकी योनियोंमें गिरानेकी बात कही। अब उसी बातको लेकर भगवान् यहाँ कहते हैं कि मनुष्यजन्ममें मुझे प्राप्त करनेका दुर्लभ अवसर पाकर भी वे आसुर मनुष्य मेरी प्राप्ति न करके पशु? पक्षी आदि आसुरी योनियोंमें चले जाते हैं और बारबार उन आसुरी योनियोंमें ही जन्म लेते रहते हैं।मामप्राप्यैव पदसे भगवान् पश्चात्तापके साथ कहते हैं कि अत्यन्त कृपा करके मैंने जीवोंको मनुष्यशरीर देकर इन्हें अपना उद्धार करनेका मौका दिया और यह विश्वास किया कि ये अपना उद्धार अवश्य कर लेंगे परन्ते ये नराधम इतने मूढ़ और विश्वासघाती निकले कि जिस शरीरसे मेरी प्राप्ति करनी थी? उससे मेरी प्राप्ति न करके उलटे अधम गतिको चले गये मनुष्यशरीर प्राप्त हो जानेके बाद वह कैसा ही आचरणवाला क्यों न हो अर्थात् दुराचारीसेदुराचारी क्यों न हो? वह भी यदि चाहे तो थो़ड़ेसेथोड़े समयमें (गीता 9। 30 -- 31) और जीवनके अन्तकालमें (गीता 8। 5) भी भगवान्को प्राप्त कर सकता है। कारण कि समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु (गीता 9। 29) कहकर भगवान्ने अपनी प्राप्ति सबके लिये अर्थात् प्राणिमात्रके लिये खुली रखी है। हाँ? यह बात हो सकती है कि पशुपक्षी,आदिमें उनको प्राप्त करनेकी योग्यता नहीं है परन्तु भगवान्की तरफसे तो किसीके लिये भी मना नहीं है। ऐसा अवसर सर्वथा प्राप्त हो जानेपर भी ये आसुर मनुष्य भगवान्को प्राप्त न करके अधम गतिमें चले जाते हैं? तो इनकी इस दुर्गतिको देखकर परम दयालु प्रभु दुःखी होते हैं।ततो यान्त्यधमां गतिम् -- आसुरी योनियोंमें जानेपर भी उनके सभी पाप पूरे नष्ट नहीं होते। अतः उन बचे हुए पापोंको भोगनेके लिये वे उन आसुरी योनियोंसे भी भयङ्कर अधम गतिको अर्थात् नरकोंको प्राप्त होते हैं।यहाँ शङ्का हो सकती है कि आसुरी योनियोंको प्राप्त हुए मनुष्योंको तो उन योनियोंमें भगवान्को प्राप्त करनेका अवसर ही नहीं है और उनमें वह योग्यता भी नहीं है? फिर भगवान्ने ऐसा क्यों कहा कि वे मेरेको प्राप्त न करके उससे भी अधम गतिमें चले जाते हैं इसका समाधान यह है कि भगवान्का ऐसा कहना आसुरी योनियोंको प्राप्त होनेसे पूर्व मनुष्यशरीरको लेकर ही है। तात्पर्य है कि मनुष्यशरीरको पाकर? मेरी प्राप्तिका अधिकार पाकर भी वे मनुष्य मेरी प्राप्ति न करके जन्मजन्मान्तरमें आसुरी योनियोंको प्राप्त होते हैं। इतना ही नहीं? वे उन आसुरी योनियोंसे भी नीचे कुम्भीपाक आदि घोर नरकोंमें चले जाते हैं। विशेष बात भगवत्प्राप्तिके अथवा कल्याणके उद्देश्यसे दिये गये मनुष्यशरीरको पाकर भी मनुष्य कामना? स्वार्थ एवं अभिमानके वशीभूत होकर चोरीडकैती? झूठकपट? धोखा? विश्वासघात? हिंसा आदि जिन कर्मोंको करते हैं? उनके दो परिणाम होते हैं -- (1) बाहरी फलअंश और (2) भीतरी संस्कारअंश। दूसरोंको दुःख देनेपर उनका (जिनको दुःख दिया गया है) तो वही नुकसान होता है? जो प्रारब्धसे होनेवाला है परन्तु जो दुःख देते हैं? वे नया पाप करते हैं? जिसका फल नरक उन्हें भोगना ही पड़ता है। इतना ही नहीं? दुराचारोंके द्वारा जो नये पाप होनेके बीज बोये जाते हैं अर्थात् उन दुराचारोंके द्वारा अहंतामें जो दुर्भाव बैठ जाते हैं? उनसे मनुष्यका बहुत भयंकर नुकसान होता है। जैसे? चोरीरूप कर्म करनेसे पहले मनुष्य स्वयं चोर बनता है क्योंकि वह चोर बनकर ही चोरी करेगा और चोरी करनेसे अपनेमें (अहंतामें) चोरका भाव दृढ़ हो जायगा (टिप्पणी प0 827.1)। इस प्रकार चोरीके संस्कार उसकी अहंतामें बैठ जाते हैं। ये संस्कार मनुष्यका बड़ा भारी पतन करते हैं -- उससे बारबार चोरीरूप पाप करवाते है और फलस्वरूप नरकोंमें ले जाते हैं। अतः जबतक वह मनुष्य अपना कल्याण नहीं कर लेता अर्थात् जबतक वह अपनी अहंतामें बैठाये हुए दुर्भावोंको नहीं मिटाता? तबतक वे दुर्भाव जन्मजन्मान्तरतक दुराचारोंको बल देते रहेंगे? उकसाते रहेंगे और उनके कारण वे आसुरी योनियोंमें तथा उससे भी भयङ्कर नरक आदिमें दुःख? सन्ताप? आफत आदि पाते ही रहेंगे। उन आसुरी योनियोंमें भी उनकी प्रकृति और प्रवृत्तिके अनुसार यह देखा जाता है कि कई पशुपक्षी? भूतपिशाच? कीटपतंग आदि सौम्यप्रकृतिप्रधान होते हैं और कई क्रूरप्रकृतिप्रधान होते हैं। इस तरह उनकी प्रकृति(स्वभाव) में भेद उनकी अपनी बनायी हुई शुद्ध या अशुद्ध अहंताके कारण ही होते हैं। अतः उन योनियोंमें अपनेअपने कर्मोंका फलभोग होनेपर भी उनकी प्रकृतिके भेद वैसे ही बने रहते हैं। इतना ही नहीं सम्पूर्ण योनियोंको और नरकोंको भोगनेके बाद किसी क्रमसे अथवा भगवत्कृपासे उनको मनुष्यशरीर प्राप्त हो भी जाता है? तो भी उनकी अहंतामें बैठे हुए कामक्रोधादि दुर्भाव पहलेजैसे ही रहते हैं (टिप्पणी प0 827.2)। इसी प्रकार जो स्वर्गप्राप्तिकी कामनासे यहाँ शुभ कर्म करते हैं? और मरनेके बाद उन कर्मोंके अनुसार स्वर्गमें जाते हैं? वहाँ उनके कर्मोंका फलभोग तो हो जाता है? पर उनके स्वभावका परिवर्तन नहीं होता अर्थात् उनकी अहंतामें परिवर्तन नहीं होता (टिप्पणी प0 827.3)। स्वभावको बदलनेका? शुद्ध बनानेका मौका तो मनुष्यशरीरमें ही है। सम्बन्ध -- पूर्वश्लोकमें भगवान्ने कहा कि ये जीव मनुष्यशरीरमें मेरी प्राप्तिका अवसर पाकर भी मुझे प्राप्त नहीं करते? जिससे मुझे उनको अधम योनिमें भेजना पड़ता है। उनका अधम योनिमें और अधम गति(नरक) में जानेका मूल कारण क्या है -- इसको भगवान् आगेके श्लोकमें बताते हैं।",

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या -- एतैर्विमुक्तः कौन्तेय ৷৷. ततो याति परां गतिम् -- पूर्वश्लोकमें जिनको नरकका दरवाजा बताया गया है? उन्हीं काम? क्रोध और लोभको यहाँ तमोद्वार कहा गया है। तम् नाम अन्धकारका है? जो अज्ञानसे उत्पन्न होता है -- तमस्त्वज्ञानजं विद्धि (गीता 14। 8)। तात्पर्य है कि इन काम आदिके,कारण मेरे साथ ये धनसम्पत्ति? स्त्रीपुरुष? घरपरिवार आदि पहले भी नहीं थे और पीछे भी नहीं रहेंगे और अब भी इनसे प्रतिक्षण वियोग हो रहा है अतः इनमें ममता करनेसे आगे मेरी क्या दशा होगी आदि बातोंकी तरफ दृष्टि जाती ही नहीं अर्थात् बुद्धिमें अन्धकार छाया रहता है। अतः इन काम आदिसे मुक्त होकर जो अपने कल्याणका आचरण करता है? वह परमगतिको प्राप्त हो जाता है। इसलिये साधकको इस बातकी विशेष सावधानी रखनी चाहिये कि वह काम? क्रोध और लोभ -- तीनोंसे सावधान रहे। कारण कि इन तीनोंको साथमें रखते हुए जो साधन करता है? वह वास्तवमें असली साधक नहीं है। असली साधक वह होता है? जो इन दोषोंको अपने साथ रहने ही नहीं देता। ये दोष उसको हर समय खटकते रहते हैं क्योंकि इनको साथमें रहनेका अवसर देना ही बड़ी भारी गलती है।मनुष्य साधनकी तरफ तो ध्यान देते हैं? पर साथमें जो कामक्रोधादि दोष रहते हैं? उनसे हमारा कितना अहित होता है -- इस तरफ वे ध्यान कम देते हैं। इस कमीके कारण ही साधन करते हुए सदाचार भी होते रहते हैं और दुराचार भी होते रहते हैं सद्गुण भी आते हैं और दुर्गुण भी साथ रहते हैं। जप? ध्यान? कीर्तन? सतसङ्ग? स्वाध्याय? तीर्थ? व्रत आदि करके हम अपनेको शुद्ध बना लेंगे -- ऐसा भाव साधकमें विशेष रहता है परन्तु जो हमें अशुद्ध कर रहे हैं? उन दुर्गुणदुराचारोंको हटानेका खयाल साधकमें कम रहता है? इसलिये --,आसुप्तेरामृते कालं नयेद् वेदान्तचिन्तया। न वा दद्यादवसरं कामादीनां मनागपि।।नींद खुलनेसे लेकर नींद आनेतक और जिस दिन पता लगे? उस दिनसे लेकर मौत आनेतक -- सबकासब समय परमात्मतत्त्वके (सगुणनिर्गुणके) चिन्तनमें ही लगाये। चिन्तनके सिवाय काम आदिको किञ्चिन्मात्र भी अवसर न दे।एतैर्विमुक्तः का यह मतलब नहीं है कि जब हम दुर्गुणदुराचारोंसे सर्वथा छूट जायँगे? तब साधन करेंगे किंतु साधकको भगवत्प्राप्तिका मुख्य उद्देश्य रखकर इनसे छूटनेका भी लक्ष्य रखना है। कारण कि झूठ? कपट? बेईमानी? काम? क्रोध आदि हमारे साथमें रहेंगे? तो नयीनयी अशुद्धि -- नयेनये पाप होते रहेंगे? जिससे साधनका साक्षात् लाभ नहीं होगा। यही कारण है कि वर्षोंतक साधनमें लगे रहनेपर भी साधक अपनी वास्तविक उन्नति नहीं देखते? उनको अपनेमें विशेष परिवर्तनका अनुभव नहीं होता। इन दोषोंसे रहित होनेपर शुद्धि स्वतःस्वाभाविक आती है। जीवमें अशुद्धि तो संसारकी तरफ लगनेसे ही आयी है? अन्यथा परमात्माका अंश होनेसे वह तो स्वतः ही शुद्ध है -- ईस्वर अंस जीव अबिनासी। चेतन अमल सहज सुखरासी।।(मानस 7। 117। 1)श्रेयः आचरति का तात्पर्य यह है कि काम? क्रोध और लोभ -- इनमेंसे किसीको भी लेकर आचरण नहीं होना चाहिये अर्थात् असाधन(निषिद्ध आचरण) से रहित शुद्ध साधन होना चाहिये। भीतरमें कभी कोई वृत्ति आ भी जाय? तो उसको आचरणमें न आने दे। अपनी तरफसे तो (काम? क्रोधादिकी) वृत्तियोंको दूर करनेका ही उद्योग करे। अगर अपने उद्योगसे न दूर हों तो हे नाथ हे नाथ हे नाथ ऐसे भगवान्को पुकारे। गोस्वामी तुलसीदासजी महाराज कहते हैं -- मम हृदय भवन प्रभु तोरा। तहँ बसे आइ बहु चोरा।। अति कठिन करहिं बरजोरा। मानहिं नहिं बिनय निहोरा।।(विनयपत्रिका 125। 2 -- 3) सम्बन्ध -- जो अपने कल्याणके लिये शास्त्रविधिके अनुसार चलते हैं? उनको तो परमगतिकी प्राप्ति होती है? पर जो ऐसा न करके मनमाने ढङ्गसे आचरण करते हैं? उनकी क्या गति होती है -- यह आगेके श्लोकमें बताते हैं।",

            "Devnagri": "व्याख्या -- एतैर्विमुक्तः कौन्तेय ৷৷. ततो याति परां गतिम् -- पूर्वश्लोकमें जिनको नरकका दरवाजा बताया गया है? उन्हीं काम? क्रोध और लोभको यहाँ तमोद्वार कहा गया है। तम् नाम अन्धकारका है? जो अज्ञानसे उत्पन्न होता है -- तमस्त्वज्ञानजं विद्धि (गीता 14। 8)। तात्पर्य है कि इन काम आदिके,कारण मेरे साथ ये धनसम्पत्ति? स्त्रीपुरुष? घरपरिवार आदि पहले भी नहीं थे और पीछे भी नहीं रहेंगे और अब भी इनसे प्रतिक्षण वियोग हो रहा है अतः इनमें ममता करनेसे आगे मेरी क्या दशा होगी आदि बातोंकी तरफ दृष्टि जाती ही नहीं अर्थात् बुद्धिमें अन्धकार छाया रहता है। अतः इन काम आदिसे मुक्त होकर जो अपने कल्याणका आचरण करता है? वह परमगतिको प्राप्त हो जाता है। इसलिये साधकको इस बातकी विशेष सावधानी रखनी चाहिये कि वह काम? क्रोध और लोभ -- तीनोंसे सावधान रहे। कारण कि इन तीनोंको साथमें रखते हुए जो साधन करता है? वह वास्तवमें असली साधक नहीं है। असली साधक वह होता है? जो इन दोषोंको अपने साथ रहने ही नहीं देता। ये दोष उसको हर समय खटकते रहते हैं क्योंकि इनको साथमें रहनेका अवसर देना ही बड़ी भारी गलती है।मनुष्य साधनकी तरफ तो ध्यान देते हैं? पर साथमें जो कामक्रोधादि दोष रहते हैं? उनसे हमारा कितना अहित होता है -- इस तरफ वे ध्यान कम देते हैं। इस कमीके कारण ही साधन करते हुए सदाचार भी होते रहते हैं और दुराचार भी होते रहते हैं सद्गुण भी आते हैं और दुर्गुण भी साथ रहते हैं। जप? ध्यान? कीर्तन? सतसङ्ग? स्वाध्याय? तीर्थ? व्रत आदि करके हम अपनेको शुद्ध बना लेंगे -- ऐसा भाव साधकमें विशेष रहता है परन्तु जो हमें अशुद्ध कर रहे हैं? उन दुर्गुणदुराचारोंको हटानेका खयाल साधकमें कम रहता है? इसलिये --,आसुप्तेरामृते कालं नयेद् वेदान्तचिन्तया। न वा दद्यादवसरं कामादीनां मनागपि।।नींद खुलनेसे लेकर नींद आनेतक और जिस दिन पता लगे? उस दिनसे लेकर मौत आनेतक -- सबकासब समय परमात्मतत्त्वके (सगुणनिर्गुणके) चिन्तनमें ही लगाये। चिन्तनके सिवाय काम आदिको किञ्चिन्मात्र भी अवसर न दे।एतैर्विमुक्तः का यह मतलब नहीं है कि जब हम दुर्गुणदुराचारोंसे सर्वथा छूट जायँगे? तब साधन करेंगे किंतु साधकको भगवत्प्राप्तिका मुख्य उद्देश्य रखकर इनसे छूटनेका भी लक्ष्य रखना है। कारण कि झूठ? कपट? बेईमानी? काम? क्रोध आदि हमारे साथमें रहेंगे? तो नयीनयी अशुद्धि -- नयेनये पाप होते रहेंगे? जिससे साधनका साक्षात् लाभ नहीं होगा। यही कारण है कि वर्षोंतक साधनमें लगे रहनेपर भी साधक अपनी वास्तविक उन्नति नहीं देखते? उनको अपनेमें विशेष परिवर्तनका अनुभव नहीं होता। इन दोषोंसे रहित होनेपर शुद्धि स्वतःस्वाभाविक आती है। जीवमें अशुद्धि तो संसारकी तरफ लगनेसे ही आयी है? अन्यथा परमात्माका अंश होनेसे वह तो स्वतः ही शुद्ध है -- ईस्वर अंस जीव अबिनासी। चेतन अमल सहज सुखरासी।।(मानस 7। 117। 1)श्रेयः आचरति का तात्पर्य यह है कि काम? क्रोध और लोभ -- इनमेंसे किसीको भी लेकर आचरण नहीं होना चाहिये अर्थात् असाधन(निषिद्ध आचरण) से रहित शुद्ध साधन होना चाहिये। भीतरमें कभी कोई वृत्ति आ भी जाय? तो उसको आचरणमें न आने दे। अपनी तरफसे तो (काम? क्रोधादिकी) वृत्तियोंको दूर करनेका ही उद्योग करे। अगर अपने उद्योगसे न दूर हों तो हे नाथ हे नाथ हे नाथ ऐसे भगवान्को पुकारे। गोस्वामी तुलसीदासजी महाराज कहते हैं -- मम हृदय भवन प्रभु तोरा। तहँ बसे आइ बहु चोरा।। अति कठिन करहिं बरजोरा। मानहिं नहिं बिनय निहोरा।।(विनयपत्रिका 125। 2 -- 3) सम्बन्ध -- जो अपने कल्याणके लिये शास्त्रविधिके अनुसार चलते हैं? उनको तो परमगतिकी प्राप्ति होती है? पर जो ऐसा न करके मनमाने ढङ्गसे आचरण करते हैं? उनकी क्या गति होती है -- यह आगेके श्लोकमें बताते हैं।",

He who has renounced the authority of the Vedas which, like a mother, is eally disposed and kind to all, and which, like a beaconlight, points out what is good and what is evil, does not attain perfection nor happiness nor the Supreme Goal. He who pays no attention to prescribed actions and follows the promptings of desire awakened by the senses, does not obtain God."

            "Hindi": "व्याख्या -- यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते -- जो लोग शास्त्रविधिकी अवहेलना करके शास्त्रविहित यज्ञ करते हैं? दान करते हैं? परोपकार करते हैं? दुनियाके लाभके लिये तरहतरहके कई अच्छेअच्छे काम करते हैं परन्तु वह सब करते हैं -- कामकारतः (टिप्पणी प0 830) अर्थात् शास्त्रविधिकी तरफ ध्यान न देकर अपने मनमाने ढङ्गसे करते हैं। मनमाने ढङ्गसे करनेमें कारण यह है कि उनके भीतर जो काम? क्रोध आदि पड़े रहते हैं? उनकी परवाह न करके वे बाहरी आचरणोंसे ही अपनेको बड़ा मानते हैं। तात्पर्य है कि वे बाहरके आचरणोंको ही श्रेष्ठ समझते हैं। दूसरे लोग भी बाहरके आचरणोंको ही विशेषतासे देखते हैं। भीतरके भावोंको? सिद्धान्तोंको जाननेवाले लोग बहुत कम होते हैं। परन्तु वास्तवमें भीतरके भावोंका ही विशेष महत्त्व है।अगर भीतरमें दुर्गुणदुर्भाव रहते हैं और बाहरसे बड़े भारी त्यागीतपस्वी बन जाते हैं? तो अभिमानमें आकर दूसरोंकी ताड़ना कर देते हैं। इस प्रकार भीतरमें ब़ढ़े हुए देहाभिमानके कारण उनके गुण भी दोषमें परिणत हो जाते हैं? उनकी महिमा निन्दामें परिणत हो जाती है? उनका त्याग रागमें? आसक्तिमें? भोगोंमें परिणत हो जाता है और आगे चलकर वे पतनमें चले जाते हैं। इसलिये भीतरमें दोषोंके रहनेसे ही वे शास्त्रविधिका त्याग करके मनमाने ढङ्गसे आचरण करते हैं।जैसे रोगी अपनी दृष्टिसे तो कुपथ्यका त्याग और पथ्यका सेवन करता है? पर वह आसक्तिवश कुपथ्य ले लेता है? जिससे उसका स्वास्थ्य और अधिक खराब हो जाता है। ऐसे ही वे लोग अपनी दृष्टिसे अच्छेअच्छे काम करते हैं? पर भीतरमें काम? क्रोध और लोभका आवेश रहनेसे वे शास्त्रविधिकी अवहेलना करके मनमाने ढङ्गसे काम करने लग जाते हैं? जिससे वे अधोगतिमें चले जाते हैं।न स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति -- आसुरीसम्पदावाले जो लोग शास्त्रविधिका त्याग करके यज्ञ आदि शुभ कर्म करते हैं? उनको धन? मान? आदर आदिके रूपमें कुछ प्रसिद्धिरूप सिद्धि मिल सकती है? पर वास्तवमें अन्तःकरणकी शुद्धिरूप जो सिद्धि है? वह उनको नहीं मिलती।न सुखम् -- उनको सुख भी नहीं मिलता क्योंकि उनके भीतरमें कामक्रोधादिकी जलन बनी रहती है। पदार्थोंके संयोगसे होनेवाला सुख उन्हें मिल सकता है? पर वह सुखदुःखोंका कारण ही है अर्थात् उससे दुःखहीदुःख पैदा होते हैं (गीता 5। 22)। तात्पर्य यह है कि पारमार्थिक मार्गमें मिलनेवला सात्त्विक सुख उनको नहीं मिलता।न परां गतिम् -- उनको परमगति भी नहीं मिलती। परमगति मिले ही कैसे पहले तो वे परमगतिको मानते ही नहीं और यदि मानते भी हैं? तो भी वह उनको मिल नहीं सकती क्योंकि काम? क्रोध और लोभके कारण उनके कर्म ही ऐसे होते हैं।सिद्धि? सुख और परमगतिके न मिलनेका तात्पर्य यह है कि वे आचरण तो श्रेष्ठ करते हैं? जिससे उन्हें सिद्धि? सुख और परमगतिकी प्राप्ति हो सके परन्तु भीतरमें काम? क्रोध? लोभ? अभिमान आदि रहनेसे उनके अच्छे आचरण भी बुराईमें ही चले जाते हैं। इससे उनको उपर्युक्त चीजें नहीं मिलतीं। यदि ऐसा मान लिया जाय कि उनके आचरण ही बुरे होते हैं? तो भगवान्का न स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम् -- ऐसा कहना बनेगा ही नहीं क्योंकि प्राप्ति होनेपर ही निषेध होता है -- प्राप्तौ सत्यां निषेधः। सम्बन्ध -- शास्त्रविधिका त्याग करनेसे मनुष्यको सिद्धि आदिकी प्राप्ति नहीं होती? इसलिये मनुष्यको क्या करना चाहिये -- इसे आगेके श्लोकमें बताते हैं।",

A man who is anxious to obtain eternal bliss should respect the Vedas and the Smritis which lay down the code of right conduct. He should readily renounce whatever the scriptures teach him to abandon and accept whatever he is directed to accept.He who is thus entirely devoted to the Vedas cannot meet with misfortune, grief or delusion. No mother is more kind than the scriptures for they restrain us from doing evil and bestow on us the greatest good (liberation or Moksha). Therefore treat the scriptures with great respect. Renounce all that the scriptures prohibit.
